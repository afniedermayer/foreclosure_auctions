  We develop a novel theory of real estate foreclosure auctions, which

  and as a buyer for high prices. The theory yields several
  empirically testable predictions concerning the strategic behavior
  of the agents, both under symmetric and asymmetric
  information. Using novel data from Palm Beach County (FL, US), we
  find evidence of both strategic bidding and asymmetric information,
  with the lender being the informed party. Moreover, the data are
  consistent with moral hazard in mortgage securitization:
  banks collect less information about the value
  of the mortgage collateral.

\section{Introduction}

Foreclosures of real estate have a substantial economic impact. In
2013, 609,000 residential sales in the U.S. were foreclosure related
(foreclosure auctions or sales of real estate owned by a lender),
amounting to 10.3\% of total residential sales.\footnote{See
  \url{http://www.realtytrac.com/Content/foreclosure-market-report/december-and-year-end-2013-us-residential-and-foreclosure-sales-report-7967}.}
Foreclosures played an even larger role during the 2007 and 2008
financial crisis, when "four million families [...] lost their homes
to foreclosure and another four and a half million [...] slipped into
the foreclosure process or are seriously behind on the mortgage
payments" \cite[Financial Crisis Inquiry Report,][p. xv]{angelides2011financial}. 
%\begin{comment}
Preceding the foreclosure wave, the securitization of mortgages increased from 30 per cent in
1995 to 80 per cent in 2006 \cite[p. 19]{dewatripont2010balancing}. It is widely
believed that the securitization of mortgages led to moral hazard for originating banks and that
"collapsing mortgage-lending
standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline lit and spread the
flame of contagion and crisis" \cite[p. xxiii]{angelides2011financial}.\footnote{See
\cite{brunnermeier2009deciphering,mian2009consequences,keys2008did,tirole2011illiquidity} for the
academic literature.}

\AN{I added back the commented out text. We are already massively underselling our results
and present our results in a very unappealing way for a general audience. No need
to make it even worse. I spent quite some time reading \cite{dewatripont2010balancing},
\cite{angelides2011financial}, etc., which are probably the best sources for our purposes.
Art, if you find something better/a better source, please let me know.}

We develop a novel theory of foreclosure auctions, incorporating the
institutional details of foreclosures. 
Our theory serves both a
better understanding of the foreclosure process and  also provides insight about the moral hazard involved
in securitization.

A foreclosure auction is run by a government agency (in our data set the Clerk and Comptroller's Office of Palm Beach
County, FL), after a mortgagee stopped making payments to the
lender. The lender, typically a bank, and third-party bidders,
typically real estate brokers, participate in this auction. An
important feature of foreclosure auctions is that payments up to the
\emph{judgment amount} (which is basically the amount owed\footnote{The judgment amount
chosen by the court is by and large the amount owed to the bank. It can additionally include 
unpaid utilities fees, legal fees, etc.}) are paid to the lender, payments
above the judgment amount, if any, are paid to the owner of the
property. The owner typically does not participate. In such an
auction, the bank essentially acts as a seller below the judgment
amount, and as a buyer above the judgment amount.

Another important feature of foreclosure auctions is that the bank is
likely to have superior information about the value of the property. There are several reasons for
this. First, lenders typically spend large resources on appraisals to
get a more precise value of the collateral before granting
mortgages. %\AN{cite stroebel} 
Second, banks also typically put
significant effort in assessing the probability of default of
potential borrowers. The probability of default is well known to be
negatively correlated with the value of the collateral \cite[see][and the references therein]{qi2009loss}. 

Unlike in a regular real estate sales, this information is not readily available to the buyers. The owner is neither obligated nor may have an incentive to cooperate with the foreclosing lender in providing access to the property to the potential buyers. Moreover, the properties in foreclosure are sometimes abandoned by their owners, making buyer access and physical inspection problematic.
% Hence, the bank's signal about
% the financial soundness of the borrower also serves as a signal for
% the value of the property. 
% Third, banks often provide home equity lines of credit to homeowners. These lines of credit can be used for home renovations that likely add value to the house, and the bank will be informed about such investments made by the owner.

\AN{I commented out the text on the bank verifiably disclosing info, since it's a red herring and not really
helpful in understanding what our paper is about.}




In contrast to the bank, which is mostly interested in reselling the
property and may have superior information about quality, brokers
typically participate with the intent of renovating the
property.\footnote{When visiting websites of several brokers
  participating in the foreclosure auctions in our data set, we could
  see that they often specialize in renovating foreclosed properties.}
The costs of renovation are to a much larger degree driven by brokers'
idiosyncratic components, which, at least to a first approximations, may be independent from the bank's information about the quality.\footnote{Assuming private
  values also helps us to focus on the common value component on the
  seller's side, which has been ignored so far in the empirical
  literature. Our theoretical results are likely to extend to a setup
  in which buyers also have information about the common value
  component. However, such a setup would add an additional layer of complexity to
  our model. Further, for a better
  understanding of moral hazard in the securitization process, what
  matters is the common value component on the \emph{seller's side}.} In our model, the broker's valuation generally depends both on the quality and its own idiosyncratic component.

% The brokers' expected payoffs depend both of the bank's information
% and on their own idiosyncratic components (signals). The latter may
% reflect their own value added to the property.\footnote{When
% visiting websites of several brokers participating in the
% foreclosure auctions in our data set, we could see that they often
% specialize in renovating foreclosed properties.} This value added
% may be largely independent of the baseline value of the house, so we
% assume that the broker and bank signals are independent. The
% relevance of the bank's information to the broker creates a common
% value component in the auction. However, unlike the standard common
% value model where buyers have relevant information, here is it
% assumed that only the bank is the informed party.

We derive participants' equilibrium bidding strategies in a
foreclosure auction with a common value component on the bank's side. 
However, as a
benchmark, we first analyze a symmetric information environment, where
the bank's information is known to the brokers. This independent
private value (IPV) setup is nested within our general model. Under
IPV, brokers bid their own type as in a standard English auction. The
bank bids its valuation plus a markup for valuations far below the
judgment amount, just as a seller would bid. The bank's bid takes into
account the classical trade-off of a seller: a higher bid lowers the
bank's probability of selling the house, but increases the bank's
revenue in case of sale. However, one side of this trade-off
disappears for banks that bid exactly the judgment amount: a higher
bid still lowers the probability of sale, but does not lead to higher
revenues for the bank, since the additional revenue goes to the
original owner. This change of the trade-off causes a bunching of
banks' bids at the judgment amount. If the bank's valuation is
sufficiently high -- higher than the judgment amount -- the bank does
not want to sell the property, but would want to keep it
itself. Hence, for high valuations, the bank bids its own type, just
as a buyer would do in an English auction.

A bank intent on selling the property will bid more in an asymmetric
information environment than in a symmetric information environment. 
The reason is that there is a further
effect in the bank's trade-off: the bank's bid also serves as a costly
signal about the quality of the property. Intuitively, the
bank is willing to incur the cost of an excessively low probability of
sale (given the price conditional on sale), in order to prove that the
quality of the house is high. This cost has to be sufficiently high,
so that bank's with lower qualities do not have an incentive to
imitate banks with lower qualities. This \emph{signalling premium} means 
that the bank charges more than the sum of its valuation and the 
markup in a symmetric information environment.

The bunching result from the symmetric information setup holds also with asymmetric information. Now, however, bunching has a
surprising implication:
there cannot be an equilibrium where the bank's bidding strategy is
continuous around the bunch. The reason for this is that brokers who
are supposed to drop slightly below the judgment amount will instead
prefer to wait for the price to rise above the judgment amount, as
they would then be certain to obtain a significantly higher house
quality at a slightly higher price. Since brokers will not have an
incentive to drop out at prices slightly below the judgment amount,
neither will have the bank: increasing the bid to the judgment amount
will lead to a higher revenue for the bank, while not changing the
probability of selling. This logic implies that there has to be a
discontinuity in the bank's bidding strategy below the judgment
amount. We show that the bank's equilibrium bidding strategy is
strictly increasing and continuous for low valuations, exhibits a
discontinuous jump to the judgment amount and bunching at the judgment
amount, and is equal to the bidding strategy of a buyer for valuations
above the judgment amount.


Our theory has two striking empirically testable implications. First,
there is bunching of banks' bids at the judgment amount. 
Second, in the presence of both auctions with symmetric and
asymmetric information, one should expect to observe the
following. For values slightly below the judgment amount, the
probability of sale (the probability of the bank selling the house to
a third-party bidder) first increases with the bank's bid and then
drops down discontinuously at the judgment amount. The explanation for
this consists of two pieces. First, with asymmetric information there
is a gap in the bank's bid distribution just below the judgment amount
(corresponding to the discontinuous bidding strategy), whereas for
symmetric information there is no gap. Hence, bids observed just below
the judgment amount will be from symmetric information auctions. For
other bids, one will observe a mixture of symmetric and asymmetric
information. Second, under asymmetric
information, the signalling premium leads to higher bids by
the bank and hence a lower probability of sale. Putting the two pieces
together reveals that the probability of sale will be lower in the gap
than just below and just above the gap. This implies a probability of
sale which is non-monotonic with the bank's bid at the lower bound of
the gap and decreases discontinuously at the upper bound of the gap
(which is the judgment amount).
% \footnote{If there are only two types
%   of auctions (auctions with symmetric information and one type of
%   auction with asymmetric information) there will also be a
%   discontinuity at the lower bound of the gap, so that there would be
%   two discontinuities. However, only the upper discontinuity is robust
%   to multiple types of asymmetric auctions: for all auctions with
%   asymmetric information, the upper bound of the gap is at the
%   judgment amount. However, the lower bound of the gap will be
%   different. This will smooth out the discontinuity at the lower
%   bounds of the gaps, but not the discontinuity at the judgment
%   amount.} 
  This \emph{non-monotonicity} (which appears like a
violation of the law of demand, but is really a consequence of sample selection) and \emph{demand discontinuity} are
empirically testable implications of our theory.


% This is due to the following selection effect. For prices slightly
% below the judgment amount, the symmetric information auctions are
% selected into the observable sample. This is because there is a
% \emph{gap} in the bank's bids below the judgment amount under
% asymmetric information. For prices at and slightly above the
% judgment amount, both symmetric and asymmetric information auctions
% are selected. As the probability of sale (``demand") is lower under
% asymmetric information due to the signalling premium, the observable
% demand will exhibit a downward jump at the judgment amount. Further,
% for bank's bids just below the judgment amount, the probability of
% sale increases with the bank's bid. The reason is that the closer
% the bank's bid approaches the judgment amount from below, the more
% one gets a selection into symmetric information auctions. This
% selection leads to a higher observed probability of sale, because of
% the aforementioned signalling premium in the asymmetric information
% auctions. This \emph{demand discontinuity} and
% \emph{non-monotonicity} due to the selection effect are testable
% predictions in the environment where both symmetric and asymmetric
% information auctions are present.

% The probability of sale (i.e. the probability that a realtor wins
% the auction) decreases with the seller's reserve price for prices
% far below and far above the judgment amount. However, just below and
% just above the judgment amount, the probability of sale
% \emph{increases} with the price, this effect being due to a
% selection effect.

To bring our theory to the data, we have collected a novel data set
with foreclosure auctions from Palm Beach County in Florida. We have
data on 12,788 auctions from 2010 to 2013 with a total judgment amount
of \$4.2bn and a total sale amount (the sum of the winning bids) of
\$0.5bn. The data reveal that bunching indeed occurs at the judgment
amount. We also observe that the probability of sale increases with
the bank's bid just below the judgment amount. Further, demand
exhibits a downward discontinuity at the judgment amount. This points,
as we have argued, to the presence of auctions with both symmetric and
asymmetric information in our data set.

% As we have argued, the distinguishing feature of the asymmetric
% information environment is the signalling premium. Controlling for
% the value of the house, we should expect the bank to bid higher
% under symmetric information. But at the same time, we have also
% argued that our sample contains both symmetric and asymmetric
% information auctions. Nevertheless, we are able to address the
% signalling premium directly by looking separately at
% \emph{securitized} mortgages, where, as we shall argue, the bank may
% not have superior information. By estimating the bidding strategies
% for securitized and non-securitized mortgages, we can empirically
% verify the presence of the signalling premium.

% Further empirical support for asymmetric information is provided by
% considering securitized and non-securitized mortgages.
%
% As we have argued, asymmetric information leads to a signalling
% premium in bidding. By comparing securitized and non-securitized
% mortgages, we are able to show the existence of a signalling premium
% directly, thus providing further empirical support for the existence
% of asymmetric information in foreclosure auctions.

Our theory and our data allow us to investigate how securitization affects the information about
the mortgage collateral. Moral hazard in the securitization of mortgages was a major
concern during the financial crisis.  Originating banks securitized
their mortgages and sold the mortgage backed securities on the capital market.
 This reduced banks' "skin in the
game" and thus led to moral hazard:
banks did not exert sufficient effort in gathering information before
granting mortgages and hence excessively granted mortgages \cite[see][]{mian2009consequences,dewatripont2010balancing,keys2008did}.

The connection between moral hazard at the stage of granting a
mortgage and asymmetric information at the time of the foreclosure is
the following. In the presence of moral hazard for securitized
mortgages, a bank will exert less effort in collecting information
both about the value of the collateral and the financial situation of
the borrower. One effect of this is that the bank will be less
informed about the probability of default -- this is indeed what the
literature has focused on so far. However, there is also a second
effect: once a mortgage defaults, the loss given default (and hence
the value of the collateral) matters. If the originating bank spent
less effort gathering the information about the value of the collateral
when granting the mortgage, it will also have less of an informational
advantage during the foreclosure auction.

\AN{Since the originating bank is usually also the bank servicing the mortgage 
(and hence actively participating in the foreclosure auction, I deleted the following paragraph. See 
\url{http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/epr/2012/EPRvol18n2.pdf#page=50} 
 and
\url{http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/09/pdf/basics.pdf}. Also see 
\url{https://www.usbank.com/pdf/community/Role-of-Trustee-Sept2013.pdf}, which describes that
the name of the trustee usually shows up in the legal documents, but the foreclosure is actually
initiated by the servicer.}
\begin{comment}
In addition, some of the information that would be available to the originating bank may be unavailable to the bank servicing the securitized mortgage. This information includes possible renovations implemented by the owner and financed by the originating bank through the home equity line of credit. It may also include other information correlated with the house upkeep such as the current employment and income status of the borrower. 
\end{comment}

One would therefore expect the bank to have less private information
about the quality of the house for securitized mortgages than for
non-securitized mortgages. This implies that the non-monotonicity and
the discontinuity of the probability of sale as a function of the
bank's bid should be present for non-securitized mortgages, but not
for securitized mortgages (or at least only present to a smaller
extent). An analysis of the data reveals that this is indeed the case.

We provide further evidence for banks having less information for securitized than for non-securitized mortgages by
considering bank's bidding strategies. Because of the signalling
premium, a bank bids higher under asymmetric information given the same opportunity cost of selling.\footnote{In a linear utility specification, we
  show a stronger
  result: the bank's bid increases with the degree of informational
  asymmetry. In the linear model, a parameter $\alpha$
  is the weight of the bank's signal in the broker's utility. $\alpha=0$ implies independent private values, and an increase in
  $\alpha$ can be interpreted as an increase of informational
  asymmetry. Our result is that the bank's bid increases with
  $\alpha$.}\AN{I don't think that the text of this footnote belongs into the introduction.
  With asymmetric info, banks bid more than with symmetric info.
  One would expect that monotonicity should hold: for intermediate levels
  of asymmetric info, banks submit intermediate bids. While it's nice
  that we managed to prove this for linear specifications, I don't think
  it's particularly exciting. And I don't think that an applied audience
  will care about a parameter $\alpha$, at least not in the introduction.}
  
  In order to estimate banks' bidding strategies for
securitized and non-securitized mortgages and to correct for possible
selection effects,\footnote{A different distribution of banks' bids
  for securitized and non-securitized mortgages could be either due to
  the signalling premium or due to banks having a different
  distribution of opportunity costs for securitized and
  non-securitized mortgages.} we collected additional data on the
resale prices and the tax assessment values of foreclosed
properties. These two additional variables allow us to deal with the
selection effect while simultaneously controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. This
allows us to estimate banks' bidding functions for securitized and
non-securitized mortgages. We show that for a given opportunity cost,
a bank holding a non-securitized mortgage bids more than a bank
holding a securitized mortgage. This provides additional evidence for
different levels of asymmetric information at the foreclosure stage
and is consistent with moral hazard at the mortgage underwriting stage.


%
\paragraph{Related Literature.} To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first paper providing an economic analysis of the bidding behavior
in foreclosure auctions. So far, the details of foreclosure auctions
have been mainly analyzed in the law literature (see
e.g. \cite{nelson2004reforming}).

For our theoretical analysis, we build on two strands of
literature. The first analyzes bidding behavior of buyers with
information about a common value component, starting with
\cite{milgrom1982theory}. The second, more recent, literature analyzes
auctions in which the seller has superior information, see
\cite{jullien2006auction}, \cite{cai2007reserve}, \cite{lamy}. For
bids above the judgment amount, we can use results from the former;
for bids sufficiently below the judgment amount, we can use results
from the latter literature, in particular from
\cite{cai2007reserve}. Our theoretical contribution is to show that
there are surprising predictions for the intermediate range of bids,
which are between the informed seller and the informed buyer regions.

To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first paper to provide
empirical evidence for a common value component on the \emph{seller's
  side} in an auction. In this sense, it complements the existing
empirical auction literature, which has considered testable predictions for models with a common value
component on the \emph{buyer's side}, see
\cite{hendricks1988empirical} and \cite{hendricks2003empirical} for
offshore oil auctions, and \cite{nyborg2002bidder} and
\cite{hortaccsu2012valuing} for treasury auctions.

Foreclosure auctions are particularly well suited to analyze the presence of
a common value component
on the seller's side. This is because (i) participation in the sales
is required by law and (ii) the seller is a private
organization. Without (i) (i.e. with voluntary participation)
submarkets with particularly strong adverse selection would operate at
a low scale or might even completely break down by an
\cite{akerlof1970market} type of argument. Hence, if one cannot
perfectly separate submarkets with symmetric and asymmetric
information, there is a selection effect working against finding
asymmetric information.\footnote{It is plausible that one cannot
  perfectly separate different submarkets. At least in our data set,
  we find evidence consistent with both symmetric and asymmetric
  information auctions being present.} Point (ii) matters, because
governments are less likely to have superior information. Much of the
literature has analyzed markets in which either (i) or (ii) was not
satisfied, hence even if one had looked for a common value component on
the seller's side rather than on the buyer's side, it would have been difficult 
to find it.

% Evidence of strategic behavior and asymmetric information has long
% been a focus of the empirical auction literature, beginning with
% \cite{hendricks1988empirical} and \cite{hendricks2003empirical} for
% offshore oil auctions, and \cite{nyborg2002bidder} and
% \cite{hortaccsu2012valuing} for treasury
% auctions. \cite{hortaccsu2012valuing} find evidence of dealers'
% informational advantage in Canadian Treasury auctions.

% Recently, \cite{stroebel2013asymmetric} has provided evidence of
% asymmetric information concerning the collateral value in mortgage
% lending. \cite{stroebel2013asymmetric} finds that integrated lenders
% have superior information about the quality of the houses they lend
% against, and this information allows them to reduce the probability
% of foreclosure by as much as $40\%$.

The application of our theory to securitization relates to the
literature dealing with moral hazard, such as \cite{mian2009consequences}, \cite{keys2008did},
\cite{tirole2011illiquidity}. Our analysis is consistent with the view that securitization led to moral hazard. Our analysis
is complementary to the analysis in the existing literature that
provides evidence for moral hazard with respect to the probability of
default. Our analysis highlights the importance of moral hazard with respect to the other
determinant of the expected shortfall of a mortgage: the loss given
default (which is determined by the value of the mortgage collateral).

In a wider sense, our article relates to the growing literature that
uses insights from auctions to analyze important questions in
financial markets, such as \cite{heller1998auctions},
\cite{hortacsu2010mechanism}, \cite{cassola20132007},
\cite{zulehner2013competition}, where our novelty is to apply it to mortgages.


\section{Foreclosure Process}

\AN{I suggest we move most of the following to the appendix. The reader doesn't
need to know the steps leading to foreclosure or the distinction between
judicial and non-judicial foreclosures to understand what we are doing in this
paper. We should describe the bidding procedure instead.}
Property foreclosure is a remedy allowed by law to the lender if the
borrower defaults on the mortgage. While it generally transfers the
ownership of the property to the lender, the process may be a lengthy
one and the details depend on the jurisdiction. In the US, roughly
$40\%$ of the states adopt what is called a \emph{judicial}
foreclosure, while the rest is comprised of the \emph{nonjudicial}
foreclosure states.\footnote{This and
 other information concerning judicial and nonjudicial foreclosures
 can be found in \cite{nelson2004reforming}.} In the following, we will
 restrict our attention to judicial foreclosures, since we are using a
 data set from a state with this foreclosure system (Florida).\footnote{
The main legal difference between judicial and nonjudicial foreclosure
is that in the former, the process takes place in the court system,
while in the latter, it takes place outside the courts. Judicial
foreclosures always result in the property being sold at a public
auction, \emph{the foreclosure auction}. 
% while the nonjudicial foreclosure usually involves a sale of
% the property by the trustee under the power of sale clause. The
% trustee sale may or may not be conducted through auction, but still
% have to generally comply with various state laws, even though it is
% performed outside of the court system.\footnote{A handful of states
%   (Connecticut, Maine and Vermont) allow for a \emph{strict
%     foreclosure}, where the property title is transferred to the
%   lender immediately after the default.}
% In this paper, we focus on judicial foreclosures. In our empirical
% application, we study foreclosure auctions in a judicial state
% (Florida). 
}

When the borrower defaults on a mortgage, the court grants the lender a judgment of foreclosure.
% %  \footnote{The steps below are described in relative detail
% %  at e.g.\ \url{www.nolo.com}.} 
% \AN{I removed the reference to nolo.com. If the best reference we can come up with is
% a website, I'd rather provide no reference at all. But I think \cite{nelson2004reforming}
% provides enough info (and is published in the Duke Law Review rather than on a website.)}
%   The lender then informs the borrower that it intends to begin the foreclosure process, giving the borrower a final deadline to make up the mortgage payments. If the borrower dos not make the payments, the lender proceeds to file
%   a lawsuit, usually in the county where the property is located. The
%   complaint is served to the mortgagee, usually by the county
%   sheriff. At this point, the mortgagee becomes a defendant in the
%   foreclosure lawsuit. The defendant is given a certain amount of time, usually 20 - 30
%   days, to respond. The defendant does not have to respond. The
%   defendant may choose to respond if he or she is able to raise a
%   substantive complaint, e.g.\ concerning the ownership of the
%   mortgage or unfair lending practices. If the complaint goes uncontested or the defendant does not
%   raise a substantive complaint, the lender is granted a judgment of
%   foreclosure. 
The judgment will specify the date of the foreclosure
  sale. The judgment holder is often required to advertise  the sale in a local newspaper. The title is transferred to the highest bidder as is, and certain liens and encumbrances may survive the foreclosure sale. Finding out this information is the sole responsibility of the prospective buyers.
  
Unlike in a regular real estate sale, in a foreclosure sale the bank is not allowed to run an open house, or provide individual access to prospective buyers. The reason for this is that until the sale is complete, any access to the property usually needs owner permission. The owner, however, may have little incentive to cooperate with the foreclosing lender, or may even have abandoned the property.  




The sale is conducted through a public auction.  The bank is an active participant and is 
  allowed to credit bid\AN{Art, what is "credit bid"? And do we need to mention this?} up to the amount owed (also called the
  judgment amount), while other participants (usually real estate
  brokers) are required to submit bids in cash or cash equivalent.\footnote{The bidders are often required to make an advance deposit as a certain percentage of the judgment amount. This deposit will be credited towards the bid should the bidder win the auction.}
  The
  auction is usually conducted in an open format. Some counties have
  adopted Internet auctions.\footnote{This is the case for Palm Beach
    county in Florida, the source of the data for the empirical
    application in our paper.} The property title is awarded to the
  highest bidder, and the auction price is equal to the highest
  bid. The proceedings of the auction are collected by the court. The court transfers
  any payments up to the judgment amount to the lender. In case the auction price
  exceeds the judgment amount, the additional proceedings are paid to junior liens
  holders and to the owner of the property.%
%   If the lender is \emph{not} the highest bidder, the lender
%   receives the payment equal to the minimum of the auction price and
%   the judgment amount. If the sale price exceeds the judgment amount,
%   the surplus is used to satisfy the junior liens, if any. The
%   remaining surplus is paid to the defendant.
\footnote{If the broker wins the auction but the sale price falls short of the judgment amount, the lender can
then ask the court for a deficiency judgment, to be applied against the borrower's other assets. Deficiency
judgments are relatively rare, as they are only pursued when the borrower owns other significant assets. But in 
that case, absent a sudden crash of the real estate market, the borrower is better off selling these assets and 
avoiding a costly foreclosure that is likely to reduce the borrower's credit rating.}

 another broker? any other details on auction relevant? }\AN{The name of the currently leading
 bidder is shown in the web interface. So brokers see whether the plaintiff 
 is the currently leadig bidder. 
 Assuming that the bank submits its maximum bid at the very

In the next section, we present a stylized model of the foreclosure auction that captures the main institutional details. First, the payment to the lender in the auction is capped at the judgment amount. As we show, this will result in a differential role of the lender, effectively making it a seller of the property if the bid is lower than the judgment amount, and a buyer otherwise. Second, the bank will have private information about the quality of the house. This information is also relevant to the brokers, but their valuations also depend on other  idiosyncratic factors.


\section{Model}

Consider the owner, the bank (also called the seller, $S$) and $n$
real estate brokers (or buyers, $B$) who participate in the
foreclosure auction. The judgment amount (i.e.\ the balance of the
mortgage) is denoted as $v_J$. The foreclosure auction is modelled as
variant of the (button) English auction as in
\cite{milgrom1982theory}. The auction website expedites bidding by
allowing the participants to employ automatic bidding agents. The
bidders provide their agents the maximum price they are willing to pay
(their \emph{dropout} price), and the agent then bids on their
behalf. These proxy bids can be updated at any time.\footnote{Such
  proxy bidding makes the button model even more applicable here, as
  it alleviates the need to model difficult features such as e.g.\
  jump bidding that may be present in the traditional open auctions.}
The brokers are able to observe if the bank's maximum bid has been
exceeded, while a broker's dropout price is unobservable to the
bank. The broker may therefore change its maximum bid upon observing
the bank's dropout price. As for the bank, we assume that it commits
to its dropout price.

The key difference from a standard auction is that the proceeding of
the foreclosure auction up to the judgment amount goes to the bank,
anything above the judgment amount goes to the original owner. This
effectively turns the bank into a seller for prices below and into a
buyer for prices above the judgment amount.

The winner pays the auction price $p$.  If the price exceeds the
judgment amount, $p\geq v_J$, then the bank gets $v_J$ and the owner
pockets the difference $p - v_J$. If the price is below the judgment
amount, $p<v_J$, then the banks gets $p$ and the owner gets
nothing. The property is transferred to a broker only if a broker
wins; otherwise, the bank keeps the property. It follow that if the
bank wins the auction, it effectively pays the auction price to
itself, so in reality no money changes hands in this case. But if a
broker wins, then there is an actual money transfer, from the broker
to the bank and possibly the owner as well (if the auction price
exceeds the judgment amount).

As is usual, we model the foreclosure sale (auction) as a game of
incomplete information.  As is explained in the empirical section of
the paper, banks and brokers buy houses for different purposes: banks
mostly sell the houses later on. Brokers typically renovate the
property before reselling. Motivated by this, we make the following
assumption concerning the information of the bank and the
brokers. First, we assume that the $i$th broker's idiosyncratic
signal, denoted as $X_B^i\in \mathds R_{+}$, only concerns its renovation value added
to the house. Second, we assume that the bank's signal $X_S\in \mathds R_{+}$ concerns
the baseline resale value of the house. The signals $X_B^i$ and $X_S$
will be sometimes referred to as buyers' and seller's
\emph{types}. Their realizations will be denoted as $x_B^i$ and $x_S$,
respectively.

% Given the different nature of the bank's and broker's signals, it is
% assumed that $x_B^i$'s and $x_S$ are independent.
The bank is assumed to be the informed party. Its signal $X_S$ is
normalized to equal the expected value of the house in the market, so
the bank's valuation is
\[
u_S(x_S) = x_S .
\]
The brokers do not observe $X_S$; they only privately observe their
own signals $X_B^i$. Broker $i$'s expected value of the house, given
its own signal $x_B^i$ and the bank's signal $x_S$, is denoted as $
u_B(x_B^i,x_S).$


% To capture the fact that input prices may be correlated across the
% brokers, we allow the signals $x_B^i$ to be correlated.
%
%% They, however, have information about an additional idiosyncratic
%% component of their valuations, which is incorporated in the
%% broker's signal $x_B^i$.  $x_B$ can be thought of as the renovation
%% value of the house.
%
% We make the following assumptions about the buyer valuations. We
% assume that the distributions $F_B$ and $F_S$ are potentially
% different. The reason is that banks and brokers buy houses for
% differentnt purposes: banks mostly sell the houses later on. Brokers
% typically renovate the property before reselling.



We make the following assumptions concerning the expected valuations
of the brokers.

\begin{assumption}[Broker valuations]\label{as:valuations}
  A broker's expected valuation is differentiable and strictly
  increasing in own signal $x_B$, and nondecreasing in the bank's
  signal $x_S$,
  \begin{align}
    \frac{\partial u_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_B}\geq \theta,\quad
    \frac{\partial u_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_S} \geq 0, \nonumber
  \end{align}
  for some constant $\theta>0$.  Moreover, the derivatives satisfy the
  \emph{single crossing} condition
  \begin{align}
    \frac{\partial u_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_B}>\frac{\partial
      u_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_S} \nonumber
  \end{align}

  % and
  % \begin{align}
  %   u_B(x,x) = x.\label{eq:normalization}
  % \end{align}
  \label{as:utilities}
\end{assumption}




This assumption ensures that a broker's valuation of the house is
increasing in its own signal $x_B$, and is non-decreasing in the
bank's signal $x_S$. If $u_B$ does not depend on $x_S$, we have a
special case of \emph{private values}. Otherwise, the valuations are
interdependent.



For reasons that will be clear in the sequel, we normalize the broker
signals so that the value conditional on winning the auction is equal
to the signal,
\begin{align}
  u_B(x_B,x_B) = x_B.
  \label{bnorm}
\end{align}
This normalization is without loss of generality because Assumption~\ref{as:valuations} 
ensures that $u_B(x_B,x_B)$ is continuous and
strictly increasing in $x_B$.\footnote{To see that the normalization is
indeed without loss of generality, consider the general case
$u_B(x_B,x_B)=v(x_B)$ for some function $v$. We can define the transformed signal
$\tilde x_B=v(x_B)$ and the transformed utility function 
$\tilde u_B(\tilde x_B,x_S)=u_B(v^{-1}(\tilde x_B),v^{-1}(x_S))$. Then, for the transformed
utility function and signal, the normalization holds: 
$\tilde u_B(\tilde x_B,\tilde x_B)=\tilde x_B$.}

We make the following assumptions regarding the distribution of the
signals.
\begin{assumption}[Signals]\label{as:info}
  The bank's signal $X_S$ is drawn from a distribution $F_S$ supported
  on $\mathbb R_{+}$, with density $f_S$ continuous and positive on
  the support. The broker signals $X_B^i$, $i=1,...,n$, are
  identically and independently distributed and drawn from the
  distribution $F_B$, supported on $\mathbb R_{+}$, with density $f_B$
  continuous and positive on the support.  \medskip
\end{assumption}
% We assume that the signals are independent.
% \begin{assumption}[Independence]
%   \noindent
% \end{assumption}
The independence assumption is made to simplify the analysis of the
game, by eliminating the need to consider adjustments that brokers
would otherwise make to their proxy bids following dropouts by other
brokers. Under independence, we shall see that the information in the
auction will be transmitted only from the bank to the brokers,
following the bank's dropout from the auction. After that, the brokers
would essentially have independent private values, and simply enter
those values as their (updated) proxy bids, and there will be no
updating from brokers' dropout prices.\footnote{Independence is also
  assumed in \cite{jullien2006auction}, while \cite{cai2007reserve}
  and \cite{lamy} allow the buyer signals to be correlated, but still
  independent of the seller's signal.}

The \emph{Myerson virtual value} is defined in the present setting as
\begin{align} J_B(x_B,x_S) = u_B(x_B,x_S) -\frac{\partial
    u_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_B} \frac{1-F_B(x_B)}{f_B(x_B)}.
\end{align}
We make the standard monotonicity assumption concerning
$J_B(x_B,x_S)$.
\begin{assumption}[Virtual value monotonicity] \label{as:myerson} The
  function $J_B(x_B,x_S)$ is strictly increasing in $x_B$.
\end{assumption}

In the following, we will use $x_{(1)}$ and $x_{(2)}$ for the highest
and second highest order statistics among $n$ brokers'
signals. Further, we will use $F_{(1)}$ and $F_{(2)}$ for the
corresponding distributions.

We have to reasons to focus on a model in which the seller's superior
information about the quality of the property being auctioned is at
the center of interest. First, the bank is likely to have better
information due to having gathered information about the property when
granting the mortgage. Information about the mortgagee can also serve
as an indication of how well the mortgagee maintains the
house. Second, we will later consider securitized and non-securitized
mortgages. As it will become clearer later on, there are reasons to
believe that the informativeness of the bank's signal about the
quality of the house is different for securitized and non-securitized
mortgages.

\section{Symmetric Information}
\label{sec:indep-priv-valu}

It is useful to first start with the case of \emph{symmetric
  information}, where the bank's information is known to the brokers.
This independent private values (IPV) setup is particularly useful to
highlight the role of the judgment amount, below which the bank acts
as a seller and above which the bank acts as a buyer.

% Under IPV, our normalization implies \[u_B(x_B,x_S) = x_B,\] and the
% Myerson virtual value here is simply \[ J_B(x_B) = x_B -
% \frac{1-F_{B}(x_B)}{f_{B}(x_B)}. \]
Standard arguments imply that it is a weakly dominant strategy for the
broker to choose its valuation as the drop out price, so
\[p_B(x_B) = u_B(x_B,x_S).
\]

% \begin{remark}
%   If buyer signals are independent, or, by convention, if there is
%   only one buyer, $J_B(\cdot)$ becomes the standard Myerson virtual
%   value, \[ J_B(x_B) = x_B - \frac{1-F_{B}(x_B)}{f_{B}(x_B)} .\]
% \end{remark}

The bank's bidding behavior can be best derived by first considering
two hypothetical cases. First, nothing is owed to the bank ($v_J=0$)
and hence the bank always acts as a buyer. Second, an infinite amount
is owed to the bank ($v_J=\infty$) and hence the bank always acts as a
seller. After deriving these two hypothetical cases, we can put the
two pieces together and additionally derive the bank's bidding
behavior for the transitional region in which the bank turn from a
seller to a buyer.

First, consider the case in which the bank always acts as a buyer
($v_J=0$). By standard arguments for English auctions, the bank's
optimal strategy is to bid its own type, i.e. $p_S(x_S)=x_S$.

Next, consider the case when $v_J = \infty$, i.e.\ the standard
auction where the bank acts as the seller. The brokers will drop out
at prices $u_B(x_B^i,x_S)$. If the bank decides to drop out at price
$p$, its auction revenue will be equal to $p$ if there is one, and
only one broker that is active in the auction at that price. If there
are multiple brokers active at $p$, the bank's revenue will be equal
to the second-highest dropout broker price,
i.e. $u_B(x_{(2)},x_S)$. Denote as $\hat x_B$ the broker's type
indifferent between staying in or dropping out at $p$, so that $p =
u_B(\hat x_B, x_S)$. Then the bank's expected profit is equal to
\[ \Pi_S(x_S, \hat x_B) = u_B(\hat x_B,x_S) n F_B(\hat x_B)^{n-1}
(1-F_B(\hat x_B)) +\int_{\hat x_B}^\infty u_B(y,x_S) f_{(2)}(y) dy
+x_S F_B(\hat x_B)^n.
\]

(If there is only one broker, $n=1$, then the integral term should be
excluded from the above formula.) The bank will choose the price, or,
equivalently, the broker's marginal cutoff $\hat x_B$, optimally. The
derivative of $\Pi_S (x_S,,\hat x_B)$ with respect to $\hat x_B$ is
equal to
\[ \frac{\partial \Pi_S (x_S,\hat x_B)}{\partial \hat x_B} = -nf_B(\hat
x_B) F_B(\hat x_B)^{n-1} \Big ( J_B(\hat x_B,x_S) - x_S \Big)
\]
for any $n\geq 1$. Assumption \ref{as:myerson} implies that $\Pi (\hat
x_B,x_S)$ is \emph{quasiconcave} in $\hat x_B$, and is uniquely
maximized at $x_B^*(x_S)$ that satisfies the FOC
\begin{align} J_B(x_B^*(x_S),x_S) = x_S . \label{eq:sc} \end{align}
This is, of course, a well-known result in auction theory concerning
the optimal reserve price, adapted to the setting where the buyer's
valuations depend on the seller's information $x_S$, observable to the
buyers.\footnote{See \cite{myerson1981optimal}.}  In general, the
bank's optimal strategy
\begin{align}
  p_S^0(x_S) = u_B(x_B^*(x_S), x_S) \label{eq:ps0-below-vJ}
\end{align}
may be non-monotone in $x_S$. Totally differentiating \eqref{eq:sc}
with respect to $x_S$ yields
\[ \frac{d x_B^*(x_S)}{dx_S} = \frac{1-\partial J_B/\partial
  x_S}{\partial J_B/\partial x_B} \] So a sufficient condition for the
monotonicity is \begin{align} \frac{\partial J_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial
    x_S} < 1 \label{eq:cond1}
\end{align}
It can be checked that \eqref{eq:cond1} is implied by the stronger but
more intuitive conditions
\begin{align}
  \frac{\partial u_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_S} <1,\quad \quad
  \frac{\partial^2 u_B(x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_B \partial x_S } \geq 0.
  \label{eq:cond2}
\end{align}

Now consider the case of our primary interest, $0<v_J<\infty$. If the
bank has valuation $x_S \leq v_J$, it will not drop out at the the
price above $v_J$: the bank is not entitled to any revenue in excess
of $v_J$, so staying in the auction beyond $v_J$ will only reduce the
probability of sale. So effectively, the bank's problem is to maximize
its profit with the additional constraint $p \leq v_J$, or,
equivalently, $u_B(\hat x_B,x_S) \leq v_J$. As we have seen, the
bank's profit is quasiconcave in $\hat x_B$, so the optimal price is
given by
\[
p_S^0(x_S)= \begin{cases}
  u_B(x_B^*(x_S),x_S) & \text{if $x_S<\ul x_S$,} \\
  v_J & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
\]
where the border between the separating and the bunching region $\ul
x_S$ is implicitly define by $u_B(x_B^*(\ul x_S),\ul x_S)=v_J$.

If, on the other hand, $x_S>v_J$, then the bank is not willing to sell
the house at the price below $x_S$, but also will not benefit from a
price above $x_S$ as the excess $p - v_J$ will go to the owner. It
follows that the bank's optimal strategy in this case is to drop out
at $x_S$, $p_S(x_S) = x_S$.

We summarize these findings in the proposition below. Refer to Figure
\ref{fig:equilibrium}.
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:syminfo}
  The bank's optimal strategy is given by
  \[ p_S^0(x_S) =
  \begin{cases}
    u_B(x_B^*(x_S),x_S) & \text{if $x_S<\ul x_S$,} \\
    v_J & \text{if $x_S\in[\ul x_S,v_J]$} \\
    x_S, & \text{if $x_S > v_J$}
  \end{cases}
  \]
where $x_B^*(x_S)$ is uniquely determined from $J_B(x_B^*(x_S),x_S) = x_S$.   
  The optimal strategy is strictly increasing in $x_S$ provided
  \eqref{eq:cond1} or \eqref{eq:cond2} hold, in which case the bank's
  prices are pooled over an interval $[\underline x_S, v_J]$.
\end{proposition}

%  \PX{For the illustrated example to work in Figure 1, two conditions are required: 
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item $p^0_S(x_S)$ has to be above 45-degree line (i.e., bid higher than $x_S$)
%  \item $x_S<v_J$, i.e., $p^0_S$ hits $v_J$ level before $x_S$ does.

% \end{figure}

\paragraph{Discussion} The bank's equilibrium behavior is different
depending on whether the bank's valuation is below or above the
judgment amount. The bank acts in a seller role in the former case,
and in a buyer role in the latter. The most interesting feature of the
equilibrium is the bunching region. In this region, the bank's dropout
prices are pooled at the judgment amount (see Figure
\ref{fig:equilibrium}).

The following intuition can be given for the bunching of banks' bids
at the judgment amount. Consider comparative statics with respect to
the banks valuation $x_S$. For low valuations $x_S$, the bank bids its
valuation plus the monopoly markup. The optimal bid of the bank
balances two effects in a trade-off: a higher bid increases the bank's
expected profits conditional on sale, but also lowers the
probability of selling the house to a third party. As we increase
$x_S$, this trade-off changes in a way that makes higher bids more
attractive to the bank. Hence, the banks bid increases with
$x_S$. However, at the point where the bank's bid reaches $v_J$, one
part of the trade-off disappears for price increase (but not
decreases): a higher bid by the bank does not increase the bank's
profit conditional on selling, since any additional revenues go to the
original owner. Therefore, as $x_S$ increases, the bank's optimal bid
stays at $v_J$. Once $x_S$ surpasses $v_J$, the bank actually prefers
retaining the property, since it is worth more than the amount
owed. Therefore, the bank's bid will again increase with $x_S$ for
$x_S$ above $v_J$.
% Why are the bank's dropout prices bunched at the judgment amount?
% To get an intuition for this, note that the bank will only benefit
% from a dropout price above $v_J$ if it keeps the house, i.e.\ wins
% the auction. Otherwise, if it sells the house, then even though the
% sale price would be higher than $v_J$, the bank stands to pocket
% only the judgment amount $v_J$. So if the bank's valuation is
% \emph{below} $v_J$, the bank would prefer to take $v_J$. This
% explains why there is a constraint $p\leq v_J$ in the bank's optimal
% pricing problem when $x_S \leq v_J$, which causes bunching at $v_J$
% for bank's values somewhat below $v_J$.
%
% This bunching will cause a \emph{mass point} at $v_J$ in the
% distribution of the bank's dropout prices.
This flat piece in the bank's bidding function corresponds to a mass
% point in banks' bid distributions.  Figure~\ref{fig:model_equilibrium}
% illustrates this in an example with normal distributions.

 
\section{Asymmetric Information}
\label{sec:asymmetric-information}

We now consider the general environment with common values, where the
bank will be the informed party. As we shall see, there are some novel
features in this setting compared to the symmetric information
setup. The main new feature is that the equilibrium will involve a
\emph{gap} below the judgment amount. This should be intuitive since
otherwise the bank would prefer to deviate from prices slightly below
$v_J$ to offering $v_J$, leading both to a higher average price and
not changing the probability of sale.

As with symmetric information, the bank will act as a seller for lower
types, and as a buyer for higher types. Again, we begin by considering
the extreme cases $v_J = 0$, where the bank always acts as a buyer,
and $v_J = \infty$, when the bank always acts as a seller.

\subsection{Bank-buyer Equilibrium ($v_J = 0$)}
\label{sec:vj0}

If $v_J=0$, both the bank and the brokers act as buyers, bidding in a
standard English auction.\footnote{We follow \cite{milgrom1982theory}
  and assume the \emph{thermometer} model, where the price is risen
  continuously from $0$ until there is only a single buyer left.} The
bank knows its valuation $x_S$, so will dropout at the price equal to
$x_S$. In a symmetric equilibrium,\footnote{By symmetric here we mean
  that the \emph{brokers} adopt the same strategy.} a broker's dropout
strategy $p_B(x_B)$ is found through the standard indifference
condition. The intuition is that, given the auction has reached price
$p$, if a broker decided to drop out at price $p$ instead to
$p+\epsilon$, this decision will change the broker's expected payoff
only if the bank (and the other brokers) dropped out at prices $p \in
(p,p+\epsilon)$. If the bank drops out at $p = x_S$, then in the limit
as $\epsilon \to 0$, the expected value of the house to the broker
will be $u_B(x_B, p)$. In equilibrium, the broker will drop out at a
price such that he is indifferent between dropping out and continuing,
while single crossing implies that brokers with higher types will
prefer to continue. Thus, a broker's type $X_B(p)$ dropping out at
price $p$ is (uniquely) found from the condition \[ u_B(X_B(p),p) =
p.\] Given our normalization $u_B(x,x) = x$, we see that $X_B(p) = p$,
so the broker, even though uninformed, in equilibrium will also drop
out at the price equal to its type. This equilibrium is described in
the proposition below.

\begin{proposition}[Bank-buyer equilibrium] 
  In a broker-symmetric equilibrium, both the bank and the brokers
  will drop out at the prices equal to their signals, \[ p_S(x_S) =
  x_S, \quad \quad p_B(x_B) = x_B. \]
\end{proposition}

\subsection{Bank-seller Equilibrium ($v_J = \infty$)}

\label{sec:comm-value-comp}




%
%
% 
% \subsection{Non-judicial foreclosures}\label{sub:nonjudicial}
%
% Recall that in a non-judicial foreclosure, the bank is entitled to
% the entire amount of the winning broker's bid. So we model a
% non-judicial foreclosure is simply an English auction where both the
% bank and the brokers are strategic participants.  This setting
% essentially involves a secret reserve price set by the informed
% seller (the bank) in a standard English auction. We will refer to
% this setting as the \emph{bank-seller equilibrium}.
Auctions in which the seller has information about the common value
component have been considered in \cite{jullien2006auction},
\cite{cai2007reserve} and \cite{lamy}.\footnote{These papers consider
  the case of a publicly observable seller's reserve price in a
  second-price auction.}  These papers consider the case of a public
reserve price and characterize a separating equilibrium in strictly
increasing, continuous and differentiable strategies.
% In the sequel, we shall refer to this equilibrium as an
% \emph{unconstrained} equilibrium.  In the foreclosure auction, the
% bank's revenue is constrained not to exceed the judgment amount.  In
% our data set, there are some auctions with a public reserve. But in
% the majority of the auctions, the bank is an active participant. In
% other words, the bank bids just like any other bidder.
We begin by adapting the equilibrium characterization results in the
aforementioned papers to our setting.



We restrict attention to equilibria where the bank adopts an
increasing and continuous equilibrium dropout strategy $p_S^*(x_S)$,
with a differentiable inverse $X_S^*(p)$. Given our assumption that
broker signals are independent, only the bank's dropout price is
relevant for information updating. Denote a broker's dropout strategy
as $p_B^*(x_B)$, with the inverse denoted as $X_B^*(p)$. As in
\cite{milgrom1982theory}, $X_B^*(p)$ is found by equating the object's
expected value to the broker assuming the bank drops out at $p$, to
the price $p$:
\begin{align}
  u_B(X_B^*(p),X_S^*(p)) = p \label{eq:ubgen}
\end{align}
Following the bank's dropout at a price $\tilde p$, a broker's dropout
strategy is simply $u_B(x_B,X_S(\tilde p))$ as the brokers will then
have independent private values.







% In parallel to Assumption \ref{as:myerson} in the previous section,
% we assume that $J_B(x_B,x_S)$ is monotone is the buyer's
% signal.\footnote{In the independent private values (IPV) case, $
% u_B(x_B,x_S) = x_B$ according to our normalization, and one can show
% $ \frac{F_{(2)}(x_B)-F_{(1)}(x_B)}{f_{(1)}(x_B)} =
% \frac{1-F_B(x_B)}{f_B(x_B)}$. So $J_B(x_B,x_S)$ becomes the usual
% Myerson virtual value as in the previous section.}
% \begin{assumption}[Virtual value
%   monotonicity] \label{as:virtual_value} The function $J_B(x_B,x_S)$
%   is increasing in $x_B$.
% \end{assumption}
The following proposition describes the separating equilibrium in our
model.


\begin{proposition}[Bank-seller equilibrium]\label{prop:nonjudicial}
  There is a unique equilibrium in monotone differentiable
  strategies. The bank's and the broker's inverse bidding strategies
  $X_S^*(p)$ and $X_B^*(p)$ are given by the (unique) solutions to the
  differential equations
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d X_S^*(p)}{dp}&=
    \frac{(J_B(X_B^*,X_S^*)-X_S^*)]f_{(1)}(X_B^*)}{ \frac{\partial
        u_B}{\partial x_S} (u_B(X_B^*,X_S^*)-X_S^*)f_{(1)}(X_B^*)+
      \frac{ \partial u_B}{\partial x_B } \int_{X_B^*}^\infty
      \frac{ \partial u_B} {\partial x_S} f_{(2)}(x) dx
    },\label{eq:sdifeq} \\ \nonumber
    \\
    \frac{d X_B^*(p)}{dp}&= \frac{ \frac{ \partial u_B} {\partial
        x_S}( F_{(2)}(X_B^*) - F_{(1)}(X_B^*)) + \int_{X_B^*}^\infty
      \frac{ \partial u_B} {\partial x_S} f_{(2)}(x) dx }{
      \frac{\partial u_B}{\partial x_S}
      (u_B(X_B^*,X_S^*)-X_S^*)f_{(1)}(X_B^*)+ \frac{ \partial
        u_B}{\partial x_B } \int_{X_B^*}^\infty \frac{ \partial u_B}
      {\partial x_S} f_{(2)}(x) dx \label{eq:bdifeq} } ,
  \end{align}
  % \eqref{eq:sdifeq} and \eqref{eq:bdifeq},
  subject to the initial conditions $X_S^*(\ul p) = 0$ and $X_B^*(\ul
  p) = \ul p$.  The lowest price offered by the bank $\ul p$ is given
  by $ \ul p = p_S(0) = u_B(\ul x_B, 0)$, where $\ul x_B$ is the
  lowest broker type that purchases with positive probability, given
  by the unique solution to $J_B(\ul x_B,0) = 0$.  For an
  out-of-equilibrium reserve price $p<\ul p$, brokers believe that the
  bank's type is the lowest possible.
\end{proposition}
We provide the proof in the Appendix. The proof adapts
\cite{cai2007reserve} to our setting where the bank is an active
bidder in the open auction. We also show that the full-information
price is the only price that can be offered by the lowest-type bank in
such a separating equilibrium. Thus the equilibrium outcome is unique
(assuming that the strategies are differentiable and monotone). The
out-of-equilibrium beliefs for prices lower than $\underline p$ are
indeterminate, but must be sufficiently pessimistic so as to provide
the bank with an incentive not to drop out at lower prices. The most
pessimistic beliefs (i.e.\, believing that the bank's type is the
lowest possible) are reasonable, and they indeed support this unique
equilibrium outcome.



% \begin{remark}
%   \cite{cai2007reserve} obtain a parallel result for the case of a
%   public reserve. It turns out that the bank's equilibrium reserve
%   price strategy is the same as the dropout strategy above, and the
%   brokers' dropout strategy is also the same as in their paper. The
%   intuition is that $X_B(p)$, the buyer's type who drops out at
%   price $p=p_S(x_S)$ when the bank bids in the auction is the same
%   as the marginal participating buyer type at $p_S(x_S)$ when the
%   reserve price is public. So if $p_S(x_S)$ is an equilibrium bank's
%   dropout strategy in the open auction, it will also be an
%   equilibrium reserve price strategy when the reserve is public.
% \end{remark}

There is a noteworthy property of this separating equilibrium, in
comparison with the symmetric information setup considered in Section
\ref{sec:indep-priv-valu}, the \emph{signalling premium}.
\begin{corollary}[Signalling premium]\label{cor:sp}
  Under asymmetric information, the bank bids higher, $p_S^*(x_S) >
  p_S^0(x_S)$ for $x_S>0$. The probability of sale to the broker as a function of the seller's
  price is \emph{lower} under asymmetric information than under symmetric information.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof} Our previous analysis in that section implies that the
  bank with valuation $x_S$ will set the price so that the marginal
  broker type willing to purchase at this price, $X_B^0(p)$, is found
  from the ``marginal revenue equals cost" equation
  $J_B(X_B^0(p),x_S)-x_S=0$. The price strategy itself is given by
  $p_S^0(x_S) = u_B(X_B^0(p),x_S)$. How does this price compare to the
  one with asymmetric information, $p_S^*(x_S)$? Proposition
  \ref{prop:nonjudicial} shows that there is no distortion at the
  bottom, so that the two price are equal: $p_S^*(0) = p_S^0(0)$.

  For $x_S>0$, we have $d X_S^*(p)/dp>0$. Going back the differential
  equation \eqref{eq:sdifeq}, this means that for $p=p_S^*(x_S)$, we
  must have $J_B(X_B^*(p),x_S)>x_S$, which, by the monotonicity of
  $J_B(x_B,x_S)$ in $x_B$, implies $ X_B^*(p)>X_B^0(p)$. Since
  $u_B(X_B^0(p),X_S^0(p)) = p$ and $u_B(X_B^*(p),X_S^*(p)) = p$, with
  $u_B(x_B,x_S)$ being monotone increasing in both arguments (under
  common values), we must have \[ X_S^*(p)<X_S^0(p) \implies
  p_S^*(x_S) > p_S^0(x_S)\] for $x_S>0$. Finally, to show that the probability of sale is lower under asymmetric information, note that
  \begin{align*}
  u_B(X_B^*(p),X_S^*(p))=p,\quad u_B(X_B^0(p),X_S^0(p))=p,
  \\
 X_S^*(p)<X_S^0(p) \implies X_B^*(p)>X_B^0(p).
  \end{align*} 
  Since the probabilities of sale under asymmetric and symmetric information are given by $ 1-F_{(1)}(X_B^*(p))$ and $ 1 - F_{(1)}(X_B^0(p))$ respectively, we see that the latter is higher than the former. 
  \end{proof}


The signalling premium leads to welfare losses under asymmetric
information. Consider, for simplicity, the case of a single
broker. Our normalization $u_B(x_B,x_B) = x_B$ implies that it is
efficient to transfer the object from the seller with valuation $x_S$
to the buyer with valuation $x_B$ if and only if $x_B>x_S$. Denote as
$x_B(x_S)$ the minimal buyer type that will, in equilibrium, trade
with the seller with valuation $x_S$. It is found from
$u_B(x_B(x_S),x_S) = p(x_S)$. Under asymmetric information, this type
is determined from $u_B(x_B^*(x_S),x_S) = p_S^*(x_S)$,\PX{this relation is not obvious for asym eqm. at least, when characterising eqm, it was not shown.}\AN{explain this earlier
and say something about separating equilibrium} while under
symmetric information, it is determined from $u_B(x_B^0(x_S),x_S) =
p_S^0(x_S)$. Since $p_S^*(x_S)>p_S^0(x_S)$ due to the signalling
premium, we must have \[ x_B^*(x_S)>x_B^0(x_S)>x_S .\] Thus, the
trading boundary, already distorted even under symmetric information
due to the market power of the seller, is distorted even further under
asymmetric information.

Motivated by our empirical application, we now investigate how the
bank's strategy is affected as its information concerning the common
value component becomes less precise, and hence less relevant to the
brokers. Following \cite{cai2007reserve}, we consider a linear
specification in the form
\[ u_B(x_B,x_S) = x_B+\alpha x_S, \quad\quad \alpha \in [0,1).\] Here,
$\alpha$ reflects the relevance of the bank's information for the
broker.\footnote{This specification does not satisfy our normalization
  $u_B(x_B,x_B) = x_B$, but it will if we change the broker's signal
  to $\tilde x_B = \frac{x_B}{1-\alpha}$.}  As $\alpha$ decreases, the
bank's information becomes progressively less relevant to the
broker. The case $\alpha = 0$ corresponds to independent private
values. Note that this is different from the symmetric information
case considered above since now the bank's information becomes
irrelevant rather than being revealed to the brokers. We denote the
bank's strategy $p_S(x_S;\alpha)$.
% \AN{We should provide a closed form solution for $p_S$ here (or at least
% something close to a closed form solution, like the inverse bidding function).}\AS{I added the solution in the proposition below.}
\begin{proposition}[Equilibrium of the linear model]\label{prop:slope}The bank's strategy in the linear model is given by 
\[ p_S^*(x_S;\alpha) = s^{-\mathbbm 1}(x_S)+\alpha x_S, \]
where 
  \begin{align*}
    s(x_B) = \frac{1}{\alpha}( 1-F_{(1)}(x_B))^{\frac{1}{\alpha} - 1} \int_{\underline
      x_B}^{x_B} (1- F_{(1)}(t))^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}} f_{(1)}(t)\left (t-\frac{1-F_B(t)}{f_B(t)}\right )dt
  \end{align*}
  is the maximal bank's type that trades with a broker of type $x_B$, and $\ul x_B$, the lowest
  broker participating type, is the same as under symmetric
  information, i.e. given implicitly by
  \[
  \ul x_B - \frac{1-F_B(\ul x_B)}{f_B(\ul x_B)} = 0.
  \]
  Moreover, $p_S^*(x_S;\alpha)$ is increasing in $\alpha$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}See the Appendix.
\end{proof}
This result shows that, as the bank's information becomes more
relevant to the broker, the bank bids higher. In this model, $\alpha$
affects the bank's bidding incentives through two channels. First,
there is a direct channel since the bank's information directly
affects the broker's payoff. Second, there is an indirect channel due
to the signalling premium, as we have discussed previously.

% In the linear model, the lowest bank's bid $p_S(0;\alpha)$ is equal
% to $J^{-\mathbbm 1} (\alpha \mathbbm E x_S) - \alpha \mathbbm E
% x_S$, and can either increase or decrease with $\alpha$ depending on
% the shape of the density $f_B(\cdot)$. If $p_S(0;\alpha)$ is
% increasing in $\alpha$, then $p_S(x_S;\alpha) <p_S(x_S;\alpha')$ for
% $\alpha<\alpha'$, i.e.\ the bank's bid increases with $\alpha$ for
% any $x_S$. But in general the monotonicity of the slope in $\alpha$
% only implies that the curves $p_S(x_S;\alpha)$ and
% $p_S(x_S;\alpha')$ cross at most once, with $p_S(x_S;\alpha')$
% crossing from below.

\subsection{General Case: $v_J \in (0,\infty)$}

In a foreclosure auction with $v_J\in (0,\infty)$, the equilibrium
will combine the features of the bank-seller equilibrium for lower
$x_S$, where the bank will drop out at $p_S^*(x_S)$ as described for
the $v_J=\infty$ case, and bank-buyer equilibrium for higher $x_S$,
where the bank would drop out at $p_S^*(x_S) = x_S$. However,
``stitching" these two equilibria under common values is by no means a
simple matter. To see the difficulties that arise, suppose we have a
bunching equilibrium with common values where the bank types over a
certain interval bid $v_J$:
\[ p_S(x_S) = v_J, \quad\quad x_S \in [\underline x_S,\overline x_S]
.\]
% Recall that in a judicial foreclosure, the bank is only entitled to
% the sale revenue up to $v_J$. As we have shown in the previous
% section, under IPV, this results in pooling of the seller's optimal
% price offers at $v_J$, while the offer below $v_J$ are unaffected.

To begin, we observe that there does not exist an equilibrium in
continuous strategies that involves bunching.
% For simplicity, consider the case when there is only one broker,
% $n=1$.  Incentive compatibility implies that the probability of
% transfer of the house to the broker must be non-increasing in the
% price $p$. As the probability of transfer is equal to
% $1-F_B(X_B(p))$, it follows that the broker's cutoff $X_B(p)$ must
% be nondecreasing.
If the bank's dropout strategy $p_S(x_S)$ were continuous and involved
bunching, then the brokers' dropout strategy $p_B(x_B)$ would involve
a gap below $v_J$, since otherwise the brokers who would contemplate
bidding slightly below $v_J$, would prefer to wait and drop out at a
price slightly above $v_J$, to take advantage of a dramatically higher
quality of the house they would be able to get for banks in the
bunching region. Such a gap in broker bids, however, creates an
incentive for the bank types that bid somewhat below $v_J$ to deviate
to the bid $v_J$, since this deviation leads to a higher expected
price, but does not change the probability of selling.

  

\begin{figure}[tf]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.6]{graphics/eqm_common.pdf}
  \caption{Equilibrium under asymmetric information. The thick line
  represents the bank's bidding strategy $p_S(x_S)$, the thin line
  represents a broker's bidding strategy $p_B(x_B)$.}
 \label{fig:eqm_common}
\end{figure}

In order to prevent such deviations, an equilibrium with bunching must
involve a \emph{gap} below $v_J$, with $\underline x_S$, the seller at
the lower bound of support of the bunching region, being indifferent
between bidding $v_J$ and bidding $\ul p_S<v_J$. Sellers with
valuations slightly below $\ul x_S$ will strictly prefer bidding
slightly below $\ul p_S$ to bidding $v_J$.  The bank's strategy in our
(semi-)separating foreclosure equilibrium coincides with $p_S^*(x_S)$
derived previously for $v_J=\infty$, involves a jump at $\ul x_S$ to
$v_J$, bunching at $v_J$, and truthful bidding for $x_S > v_J$.

The broker's dropout strategy will be a best response to the bank's
strategy. It will coincide with $p_B^*(x_B)$ derived for the
$v_J=\infty$ case for $x_B < x_B^*$, where $x_B^*$ is implicitly
defined by $p_B^*(x_B^*)=\ul p_S$. Then, the types $x_B \in (x_B^*,\ol
x_B$) will drop out as soon as the price has surpassed $\ul
p_S$. These brokers realize that they cannot beat the bank profitably
at any higher price. The types $x_B \geq \ol x_B$ will continue, and bid up
to their values. We must have $\ol x_B > v_J$, since otherwise the
broker bidding slightly above $v_J$ would prefer a deviation to a bid
slightly above $\ul p$ in order to avoid a loss due to a lower average
quality over the bunch.\PX{I find the last sentence hard to understand here. Maybe to put it later, after introducing how $\bar{x}_B$ is determined.}

So the bank's dropout strategy $p_S(x_S)$ and the broker's dropout
strategy when the bank hasn't dropped out, $p_B(x_B)$, are given
respectively by
\begin{align}
  p_S(x_S) & =
  \begin{cases}
    p_S^*(x_S), & \quad x_S \in [0, \underline x_S], \\
    v_J,        & \quad x_S\in[\underline x_S,v_J],\\
    x_S , & \quad x_S>v_J,
  \end{cases} \nonumber \\
  p_B(x_B) & =
  \begin{cases}
    p_B^*(x_B), & \quad x_B \in [\underline x_B, x_B^*), \\
    \ul p_S,        & \quad x_B\in[x_B^*,\overline x_B] ,\\
    x_B , & \quad x_B>\overline x_B.
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:strategies}
\end{align}
\PX{To understand the eqm better, is it possible to compare the strategies? for example, segment-wise how these two agents bid against each other? $p^*_S$ corresponds to $P^*_B$? $v_J$ vs. $\underline{p}_S$?}
See Figure \ref{fig:eqm_common}, where the bank's and broker's bidding
strategies are shown respectively by the thick and the thin
curves.\AN{maybe change lines to dashed and solid}



We now introduce the key two conditions that will uniquely pin down
the cutoff types $\underline x_S$ and $\ol x_B$ and therefore pin down
an equilibrium.  First, the $\ol x_B$-type broker must be indifferent
between dropping out at a price slightly above $\ul p$ or staying in
up to $\ol x_B$. By deviating to a higher bid $\ol x_B$, the broker
would gain the property value $u_B(\ol x_B,x_S)$ at a price equal to
$v_J$ if $x_S \in [\underline x_S,v_J]$, and $x_S$ if $x_S \in
[v_J,\ol x_B]$. So the broker's indifference condition takes the form
\begin{align}
  0 = \int_{\underline x_S}^{\ol x_B} \Big( u_B(\ol x_B,x_S)- \max \{
  v_J , x_S \}\Big) f_S^*(x_S)d x_S =: H(\underline x_S,\ol
  x_B), \label{eq:bindif0}
\end{align}
where $f_S^*(x_S)$ is the density of the bank's types conditional on
$x_S \in [\ul x_S,\ol x_B]$,
\[ f_S^*(x_S) = \frac{f_S(x_S)}{F_S(\overline x_B)-F_S(\underline
  x_S)}.\]




The second condition specifies that the $\underline x_S$-type bank is
either indifferent between bidding $\underline p_S = p_S(\ul x_S)$ or
$p=v_J$ (if $\underline x_S > 0$), or weakly prefers the bid at $v_J$
to $\underline p_S$ (if $\underline x_S = 0$):
\begin{align}
  \Pi_S(\underline x_S,\underline p_S) &= \Pi_S(\underline
  x_S,v_J),\quad\quad & (\underline x_S > 0)
  \label{eq:sindif0}
  \\
  \Pi_S(0,\underline p_S) &\leq \Pi_S (0, v_J), \quad\quad &
  (\underline x_S = 0) \label{eq:sindif2}
\end{align}
where $\Pi_S(x_S,p)$ is the bank's expected equilibrium profit if its
type is $x_S$ and it bids $p$.\footnote{See the Appendix for the
  explicit formula for $ \Pi_S(x_S,p)$.}
% There is also a possibility of a \emph{corner solution} with
% $x_S=0$.  It corresponds to \emph{full pooling} below $v_J$, and
% only requires \[ \Pi_S(0,\underline p_S) \leq \Pi_S (0, v_J) .\]

% Note that given $\underline x_S$ and $\underline
% p_S=p_S^*(\underline x_S)$, the buyer's type that is indifferent
% between buying or not at $\underline p_S$ is uniquely determined as
% $ x_B^*$.  In this form, it is clear that \eqref{eq:sindif} is an
% equation in terms of $\underline x_S, \ol x_B$ only.  Both that,
% unlike \eqref{eq:bindif0}, this equation does not depend on
% $\gamma$.
Our first result is a technical lemma below that shows existence of
cutoffs $\underline x_S, \ol x_B$ that solve the indifference
conditions \eqref{eq:bindif0} and \eqref{eq:sindif0}. Note that it
could happen that $\ul x_S = 0$, in which case the bunch extends all
the way to the left.
\begin{lemma}[Existence and uniqueness of the
  cutoffs]\label{lm:cutoffs}
  There exists a unique solution $(\underline x_S, \ol x_B)$ to the
  broker's and bank's indifference conditions \eqref{eq:bindif0} and
  \eqref{eq:sindif0}, \eqref{eq:sindif2}.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}See the Appendix.\end{proof}


Given the existence of the cutoffs, we now establish existence (and
uniqueness) of a semi-pooling equilibrium under asymmetric information
of the kind described above.
\begin{proposition}[Equilibrium
  existence]\label{prop:equilibrium_existence}
  There exists a unique equilibrium in the class of strategies given
  by \eqref{eq:strategies}.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:equilibrium_existence}]
  We begin with the bank's equilibrium strategy $p_S(x_S)$. The
  arguments from the previous sections imply that $p_S(x_S)$ is an
  equilibrium best response for $x_S \leq \underline x_S$ and $x_S
  \geq \overline x_B$, so in this proof we only consider $x_S \in
  (\underline x_S, \overline x_B)$. For $x_S \in (v_J, \ol x_B)$, the
  bank acts as a buyer, and it is a best response for it to bid its
  value, $x_S$.  So it only remains to consider $x_S \in (\underline
  x_S, v_J]$. These types will prefer to bid $v_J$ over any bid in
  $(\underline p_S, v_J)$. The reason is that the brokers with values
  $x_B<\overline x_B$ drop out immediately once the price has gone
  over $\underline p_S$. The brokers who remain will bid up to their
  values $x_B\geq \overline x_S$. The bank will prefer to bid $v_J$
  over any $(\underline p_S, v_J)$ since doing so will not reduce the
  probability of selling to a broker, but will at least weakly
  increase the price conditional on sale.\footnote{The price
    conditional on sale will be strictly higher $v_J>\ul p$ if there
    is only one broker who is active, i.e.\ has $x_B\geq \overline
    x_S$. If there is more than one broker, the expected price
    conditional on sale will be unchanged.}

  Having shown equilibrium incentives for the bank, we now turn to the
  broker. The results in the previous section imply that, for $x_B
  \leq x_B^*$, $p_B(x_B)$ dominates any other bid $p \leq \ul p_S =
  p_B(x_B^*)$. Since bidding $ p \in (\ul p_S,v_J) $ will not affect
  the broker's expected profit due to the fact that no other
  participant bids there, it remains to be shown that a broker with
  $x_B < \ol x_B$ will not have an incentive to deviate to a $p\geq
  v_J$. It is clear that such a broker will not have an incentive to
  deviate to a bid $p> \ol x_B$, since this would lead the broker to
  buy at prices that are too high and would result in a loss. Indeed,
  by single crossing, $u_B(x_B,p) < p$ for $p>x_B$, which implies
  $u_B(x_B,p) < p$ for $p > \ol x_B$.

  The incremental expected profit from deviation to a price $p \in
  [v_J,\ol x_B]$ is
  \begin{align*}
    \Delta \Pi_B &= \int_{\ul x_S}^{p} (u_B(x_B,x_S) - \max \{ v_J,
    x_S \}) f_S(x_S) dx_S
    \\
    &< \int_{\ul x_S}^{p} (u_B(\ol x_B,x_S) - \max \{ v_J, x_S \})
    f_S(x_S) dx_S
    \\
    &\leq \int_{\ul x_S}^{\ol x_B} (u_B(\ol x_B,x_S) - \max \{ v_J,
    x_S \}) f_S(x_S) dx_S=0
  \end{align*}
  where the first inequality follows from the fact that $u_B(x_B,x_S)$
  is increasing in $x_B$, while the second inequality follows from the
  definition of $\ol x_B$ as the type that is indifferent This shows
  that the broker with $x_B < \ol x_B$ will not have an incentive to
  deviate to a $p\geq v_J$, and it also follows that the broker types
  $x_B \in [x_B^*,\ol x_B]$ will bunch at $\ul p_S$.
%


  The equilibrium uniqueness follows because there are unique cutoff
  types $\underline x_S$ and $\overline x_S$ according to Lemma
  \ref{lm:cutoffs}.
\end{proof}






\section{Testable Hypotheses}
\label{sec:empir-pred}

Our theory predicts bunching of banks' bids at $v_J$ for both
symmetric and asymmetric information. Denoting the distribution of
bank's bids as $G_S(\cdot)$, we therefore have the following testable
hypothesis.
\begin{conjecture}[Bunching at $v_J$]\label{hyp:bunching}
  Under both symmetric and asymmetric information, the distribution
  $G_S(p)$ has an atom at $p = v_J$, formally,
  \[
  \lim_{p\uparrow v_J} G_S(p) <G_S(v_J).
  \]
\end{conjecture}

In a hypothetical world, in which the econometrician could perfectly
observe all forms of heterogeneity, it would be straightforward to
test for asymmetric information: our theory predicts a gap in banks'
bid distributions just below $v_J$ for asymmetric information
auctions, but not for symmetric information auctions. Hence, the
presence or absence of a gap could serve as a test for asymmetric
information.

However, one should not expect a gap if there is unobserved
heterogeneity with respect to informational asymmetry, as one certainly
would expect in reality. To what extent informational asymmetries play
a role typically depends on characteristics of the property.
For example, empirical studies show that there is little uncertainty about the quality
of condominiums and hence symmetric information is likely to be a good
approximation. For single family houses (especially in poor neighborhoods), on the other
hand, there is more uncertainty
about quality and asymmetric information is likely to play more of a 
role.\footnote{For example, \cite{allen1995implicit}
find that for condominiums observable characteristics explain a large
part of the rent (adjusted $R^2=0.911$ in a regression with the rent as the dependent
and different property characteristics, such as the number of square feet and bathrooms,
and central air conditioning, as independent variables). For single
family houses observable characteristics explain a much smaller fraction of the 
rent (adjusted $R^2=0.685$).}
% For example, some foreclosure properties may be abandoned by the owner, and the bank may know this 
% information. For such properties, the information asymmetry is expected to be the strongest. 
\AN{I replaced the abandoning of properties with single family house vs condo, because (i)
there is abundant empirical evidence for this, (ii) it is more consistent with the
story about securitization we tell later on, i.e. as bank you get info at the point
you grant the mortgage rather than later on.}
Another reason for differences in asymmetric information can be that for some 
properties, the owner is cooperating with the lender in allowing access to the 
property, thereby making the information essentially symmetric.

If the sales of some of the houses are
characterized by asymmetric information (ASI), whereas for others the
auction is essentially under symmetric information (SI), then the SI
auction will fill out the gap. Here, by SI we mean the houses where
the bank's information is also available to the broker; in our model,
this implies that $x_S$ is observable to the broker.



But heterogeneity with respect to informational asymmetry does have
empirically testable implications.
% From now on in this section, we focus on an additive model where the
% buyer's valuation is given by
% \[ u_B(x_B,x_S) = x_B+ Take the simplest example, in which there are
% two types of houses, ``symmetric information (SI) houses" and
% ``asymmetric information (ASI) houses".
The testable implication can be derived from Corollary~\ref{cor:sp}
(the signaling premium), by observing that for ASI houses the
probability of sale is lower than for SI houses for a given bid by the
bank. The empirically testable implication stems from a selection due
to the gap for ASI auctions as described below.

For SI houses, the bank and the brokers are symmetrically informed. In
our framework, this means that the bank's information $x_S$ is
observable to the broker and that there is no gap below $v_J$. For ASI
houses, $x_S$ is not observable to the broker and there is a gap in
banks' bids in the interval $(\ul p_S,v_J)$ for $\ul p_S=p_S(\ul
x_S)$. For bank's bids below the gap for ASI houses ($p_S<\ul p_S$),
we will observe a mixture of SI and of ASI houses. The probability of
sale for such prices is the average of the high SI and the low ASI
probability of sale. In the gap ($p_S\in(\ul p,v_J)$), we only observe
high probability of sale SI houses. This selection effects leads to an
increase of the probability of sale at $\ul p_S$. For $p_S=v_J$ and
above, we again observe both SI and ASI houses, hence a downward jump
in the probability of sale at $p_S=v_J$.
%
% Then again a sharp increase of the probability of sale just above
% $p_S=v_J$, since this in the interval $(v_J,p_2)$ more weight is put
% on IPV houses since ASI houses appear only when the upper ``arm" is
% played, i.e.\ with probability $\gamma$. One should not expect a
% sharp change at $p_2$, since for $p_S>p_2$ the probability of sale
% is the same for IPV and for ASI houses. The reason that
% $1-F_{(1)}(X_B(p_S)))=1-F_{(1)}(p_S)$ is that for $p_S>p_2$, one has
% $X_S(p_S)=p_S$.
This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:theory-probability-of-sale}.



In reality, one would expect that there are more than two types of
properties, that there are different degrees of asymmetric information
and hence different lower bounds $\ul p_S$ for the gaps $(\ul
p_S,v_J)$. This will smooth out the discontinuity at $\ul p_S$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:theory-probability-of-sale}, but we should still
expect that the probability of sale to increase in the bank's maximum
bid in an interval below $v_J$, and jump downwards at $v_J$. Note that
the upper bound of the gap $v_J$ is the same irrespective of the
degree of asymmetric information, hence the discontinuity at $v_J$
will not be smoothed out.  We thus arrive at the following testable
hypothesis concerning the probability of sale to the broker, denoted
as $\rho(p_S)$. We assume that the prices are normalized by $v_J$, so
that all houses have the same effective $v_J$.

  \caption{Probability of sale to the broker as a function of the
    bank's maximum bid for independent symmetric information houses

%		
  \label{fig:theory-probability-of-sale_sim}
\end{figure}
\begin{conjecture}[Probability of sale]\label{hyp:discontinuity}
  If all auctions in the data are under symmetric information, the
  probability of sale $\rho(p_S)$ is a continuous, decreasing function
  of $p_S$. If, on the other hand, the data exhibit a mixture of
  auctions with a varying degree of informational asymmetry, including
  SI auctions with a positive probability, then we should expect the
  probability of sale to the broker $\rho(p_S)$ to exhibit the
  following pattern. Initially, $\rho(p_S)$ decreases in $p_S$. Then,
  over a certain interval $p_S \in [\tilde p, v_J)$, where $\tilde p <
  v_J$, $\rho(p_S)$ increases in $p_S$. At $p_S = v_J$, $\rho(p_S)$
  drops discontinuously to a lower value, $\rho(v_J)<\lim_{p_S
    \uparrow v_J} \rho(p_S)$, and from that point on, decreases in a
  continuous fashion.
\end{conjecture}

We further illustrate the predicted pattern in Hypothesis 2 through a Monte Carlo simulation. 
In this example, we
assume that there is one broker in each auction. Her payoff is linear in the signals,
$u_B(x_B,x_S) = (1-\beta) x_B+\beta x_S$. The signals are
lognormally distributed.\AN{once we find out what parameters we used, we
can add this back: "with a mean of ** and standard deviation ** ."}
% \AN{Art, do you recall the $\mu$s and $\sigma$s
% of the lognormal distributions? I think in our simulation we had one
% broker.}\AS{no, I don't} 
$\beta$, which is the weight on the bank's information $x_S$, represents the degree of asymmetric information. It is assumed to be uniformly distributed on $[0,1/2]$, with $\beta =
0$ corresponding to symmetric information.

% \AN{We should add a description of the estimation technique here. I used a locally linear
% kernel regression with the rule of thumb bandwidth selection in stata \url{http://www.stata.com/manuals13/rlpoly.pdf}, as Art suggested. A locally linear
% kernel regression has the advantage that it's better at the boundaries. Art, 
% you know this stuff better than me and can say something better about this here.}\AS{I agree and have added the discussion.}

To detect the discontinuity at $v_J$, we split the sample at $v_J$ in two subsets. The first subset contains the observations with the bank's bid below $v_J$, while in the second one contains all observations with the bank's bid above $v_J$. Then we apply a local linear regression estimator to each subset by following \cite{fan1996local}. The well-known advantage of this method is that it provides automatic correction of the boundary bias.\footnote{See, e.g., the discussion in \cite{fan1996local}, pp. 69-70.} It allows us to consistently estimate the regression curve $\rho(p)$ not only for $p<v_J$ and $p>v_J$, but also at their limits at the boundary, i.e., $\lim_{p\uparrow v_J} \rho(p)$ and $\lim_{p\downarrow v_J} \rho(p)$. 

We choose the Epanechnikov kernel function and specify the bandwidth sequences by following Silverman's normal reference rule: $1.06sn^{-1/5}$ where $s$ denotes the sample standard deviations and $n$ the number of observations. The estimated probability of sale functions are plotted in Figure
\ref{fig:theory-probability-of-sale_sim}. We took overall 50,000 random draws. The shaded region is the $95\%$ confidence interval. 
The figure shows both a discontinuity at $v_J$ and an upward sloping probability of sale function in
the left neighborhood of $v_J$.\AN{Let's add back the following (in a footnote) once we have it:
"We have also tried different bandwidths by multiplying the
reference rule by 0.5 or 1.5. Both discontinuity and up-sloping curve occur in these experiments."}






\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

The Clerk \& Comptroller's auction website provides service for sales
on the foreclosed properties in Palm Beach county, Florida, US. The
website provides a platform for plaintiffs (mostly banks to whom property
owners hold liability) and third-party bidders (mostly brokers), to meet
in this marketplace. The ClerkAuction online platform conducts
foreclosure sales on all business days, which provides a large amount
of data on these sales.

We collected data from the website for foreclosure sales between
January 21, 2010 and November 27, 2013. Our data record all
transaction details on these sales, including winning bid, winner
identities, and judgment
amounts.% and more importantly, the property address in the case.

% With the help of property addresses, we then resort to another
% database powered by Property Appraiser's Public Access in Palm Beach
% county. There, we collected the information regarding the properties
% being sold at the foreclosure sales. In particular, we found the
% appraisal values of property for the current year, type of property,
% and transaction value for next sale after the foreclosure sales.

% We restrict our attention with the auctions that had information on
% all the winner identity, appraisal values, and next resale values.
% In total, our data set effectively includes 2047 observations.

Our data set contains 12,788 auctions with a total judgment amount of
\$4.2bn. The sum of winning bids is \$0.5bn.  Table \ref{sumstat}
reports the summary statistics for main variables.  The variable
\textit{bank winning} indicates that 84\% of auctions under study
ended up having properties transferred to bank's ownership.

% \begin{itemize}
% \item prob of having next sale, conditional on bank wins: 0.5673
% \item prob of having next sale, conditional on broker wins: 0.1107

We now turn to empirical tests of our hypotheses. Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:bunching} can be easily checked by plotting the
cumulative distribution function of banks'
bids. Figure~\ref{fig:public-reserve} shows the distribution of banks'
maximum bids. Bunching shows up very clearly: there are roughly 4,000
observations bunched at the judgment amount.

% Figure~\ref{fig:bunching} shows a graph with the empirical
% cumulative distribution of bids normalized by the judgment
% amount. Observe the similarity in shape of the curves in
% Figures~\ref{fig:model_equilibrium} and \ref{fig:bunching}. In both
% there is bunching of the bank's bids at the judgment amount. Note
% that for the numerical example in Figure~\ref{fig:model_equilibrium}
% we assumed that the bank's and the realtor's distributions of
% valuations are the same, hence the overlap for bids above the
% judgment amount. However, this does not necessarily have to hold;
% indeed Figure~\ref{fig:bunching} suggests that this is not the case
% empirically.

  \label{fig:public-reserve}
\end{figure}


Next, we plot the probability of sale as a function of the bank's
maximum bid
(Figure~\ref{fig:discontinuity-data}). Figure~\ref{fig:discontinuity-data}
shows the same kernel regression as the one shown for the Monte Carlo
simulation in Figure~\ref{fig:theory-probability-of-sale_sim}: it is a
locally linear kernel regression, the sample being split into
observations below ($p_S<v_J$) and weakly above ($p_S\geq v_J$) the
judgment amount. The most striking feature of the graph is that the
probability of sale increases with the bank's bid just before the
judgment amount and drops down discontinuously at $v_J$.
% Figure \ref{fig:tests_nonsec} shows the estimated probability of
% sale over a band around the judgment amount, chosen as $[0,9,1.1]$,
% and over a band below the judgment amount, $[0.7,0.9]$. These bands
% are chosen sufficiently wide so that the confidence intervals around
% the estimates, also shown in the figure, are informative. It can be
% seen that the estimated probability of sale over the lower band
% ($0.093$) is smaller than the probability over the surrounding band
% ($0.159$), with the difference $0.047$. Moreover, a formal
% statistical test reveals that this difference is statistically
% significant at $5\%$ level: the t-statistic of the difference in
% means test is $2.77$.


This is exactly what theory predicts in case that there is
heterogeneity in terms of asymmetric information (see
Figures~\ref{fig:theory-probability-of-sale} and
\ref{fig:theory-probability-of-sale_sim}).

To sum up, our theory describes the effects of asymmetric information
of the seller (the bank) on the outcome of the foreclosure auction,
taking into account the judgment amount. Asymmetric information has
been recognized to be highly relevant for the understanding of how
markets works, on policy implications, and on welfare analyses at
least since Akerlof's seminal contribution on the lemon's market
\citep{akerlof1970market}. In the following section, we will describe
one important application in which asymmetric information plays a
crucial role.

% \section{Applications}

\section{Securitization}
\label{sec:securitization}

% \subsection{Overview}

The securitization of mortgages massively increased before and moved
to the forefront of attention during the financial crisis. While in
1995 only 30\% of mortgages were securitized, this fraction increased
to 80\% in 2006 \cite[p. 19]{dewatripont2010balancing}. \cite{angelides2011financial} considered "collapsing
mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline
[to have] lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis" (see p. xxiii).  The
academic literature has confirmed this view and found that mortgage
securitization led to moral hazard and to banks excessively granting
mortgages, which later caused a collapse of the mortgage backed
securities market \citep{mian2009consequences,dewatripont2010balancing,keys2008did}.
See \cite{gorton2015securitization} for an overview of
the theory and of the empirical evidence for moral hazard.

Securitization can take many forms. We provide a description of the basic
procedure here that captures the basic aspects of securitization, 
for more details see \cite{cetorelli2012role,gorton2015securitization}.

The relevant actors in the securitization process are the originator, the issuer,
the special purpose vehicle, the mortgage trust, and the servicer.\footnote{Additional
actors are the underwriter, the rating agency, and the trustee. However, they are not
relevant for our analysis and hence left out.}
Securitization typically involves the following steps. 
First, the \emph{originating
bank} grants a mortgage to the home owner. Second, the \emph{issuer} pools mortgages
and sells the pool to a \emph{special purpose vehicle}. Third, the special purpose
vehicle transfers the assets to a \emph{trust} that is specially created for
a particular securitization deal. Fourth, the trust issues security shares
back by the assets in the pool, which are then bought by investors.
Interest payments by mortgagees are collected by the \emph{servicer} and
transferred to the investors through the trust. Fifth, if a mortgagee
defaults, the servicer sues for foreclosure on behalf of the trust.\footnote{Court documents
show the trustee of the mortgage trust as the plaintiff in the foreclosure auction.
However, the servicer acts as plaintiff on behalf of the trust.} Proceedings
from the foreclosure are collected by the servicer and transferred
to investors through the trust. The originating bank typically also acts
as issuer and servicer.

To avoid adverse selection, several measure are usually taken. 
First, only mortgages can be securitized for which the
credit score (the FICO score)\AN{say observable characteristics in general,
typically credit score} of the borrower is above a
threshold.\footnote{This is a somewhat simplified account, since
  securitization agencies chose two cutoffs for FICO scores: above a
  FICO score of 620, banks can securitize \emph{low documentation
    mortgages}, below a score of 600, it is very difficult to
  securitize mortgages. Between 600 and 620, banks can securitize
  mortgages, but have to provide full documentation.}  Second, the
originating bank has offers all properties with similar observable
characteristics eligible for securitization and the special purpose
vehicles randomly
pick mortgages to be securitized \citep{keys2008did}.

However, these measures do not prevent moral
hazard, since the credit score is not a perfect signal about the
expected loss of a mortgage -- which is what the originating bank or the investors
buying the mortgage backed securities ultimately care about. One
reason is that the expected loss is the product of the probability of
default and the loss given default. The credit score is only a proxy
for the probability of default, but not the loss given default. Before
the crisis, banks were known to grant mortgages with a high
loan-to-value ratio, the mortgage sometimes even exceeding the value
of the house. Since this means that only a small fraction of the
mortgage can be recovered in case of a foreclosure, this led to high
losses given default. A second reason is that the credit score is not
a perfect signal about the probability of default of a borrower. Banks
typically collect additional (soft) information to assess the
probability of default.

The securitization of mortgages reduces a bank's incentive to collect
additional information about additional components of the expected
loss (i.e. the loss given default and soft information about the
probability of default) and leads to moral hazard. \cite{keys2008did}
have shown that moral hazard led to banks collecting insufficient soft
information about the probability of default.

While the literature so far has mainly focused on the probability of
default, it is reasonable to suspect that moral hazard also led to
banks collecting insufficient information about the other component of
the expected loss, the \emph{loss given default}. This is, first,
because a high loan-to-value ratio is known to be positively
correlated both with the probability of default and the loss given
default \citep[see][and the references
therein]{qi2009loss}.\footnote{In which direction the causality goes
  is not important for our analysis. It could (and mostly likely does)
  go both ways: a high loan-to-value ratio makes strategic default
  more likely. At the same time, borrowers with financial difficulties
  are less likely to invest in the maintenance of the property, which
  decreases its value and increases the loss given default.} Second, a
more careful investigation of a potential borrower should also
directly reveal information about the value of the property.

Our theory and our data allow us to look more carefully at the
question of moral hazard with respect to the loss given default: if a
bank collected information about the value of the collateral (and hence
the loss given default) when it granted the mortgage, it is likely to
have an informational advantage over third-party bidders during the
foreclosure auction.

In particular, we can use information on whether a foreclosed mortgage
was securitized or not. If securitization leads to moral hazard, we
should expect the bank to have no (or only a minor) informational
advantage over third-party bidders for the case of securitized
mortgages. This means an independent private value auction (or only a
small common value component). For non-securitized mortgages we should
expect the bank to have an informational advantage. This means an
auction with a common value component on the bank's side.  This leads
us to the empirically testable implication that is an adaptation of
Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:discontinuity}:

\begin{conjecture}[Probability of sale for securitized and non-securitized mortgages]\label{hyp:discontinuity-sec-nonsec}
  For securitized mortgages, the probability of sale $\rho(p_S)$ is a
  continuous, decreasing function of $p_S$. For non-securitized
  mortgages, we should expect the probability of sale to the broker
  $\rho(p_S)$ to exhibit the following pattern. Initially, $\rho(p_S)$
  decreases in $p_S$. Then, over a certain interval $p_S \in [\tilde
  p, v_J)$, where $\tilde p < v_J$, $\rho(p_S)$ increases in $p_S$. At
  $p_S = v_J$, $\rho(p_S)$ drops discontinuously to a lower value,
  $\rho(v_J)<\lim_{p_S \uparrow v_J} \rho(p_S)$, and from that point
  on, decreases in a continuous fashion.
\end{conjecture}

% In this description of securitization, we abstracted away from a
% number of issues which are orthogonal to our analysis, but matter
% for other purposes. Some of these issues are that information may
% not be lost, but merely reduced by securitization. The FICO score,
% which is used as a threshold for securitization, is an imperfect
% measure for the probability of default. Evidence for this is
% provided by \cite{keys2008did}, who show that mortgages with a FICO
% score above the threshold were more likely to be securitized and
% also had higher probabilities of default than mortgages with FICO
% scores slightly below the threshold. Crossing the FICO score
% threshold from below increases the probability of default from 5\%
% to 5.5\%-6\%.\footnote{To be more precise, there are two thresholds
% for FICO scores. The analysis of \cite{keys2008did} mainly focuses
% on the threshold at a FICO score of 620 below which banks have to
% provide full documentation and below which banks can grant low
% documentation mortgages.} This reinforces our point that the lender
% has better information about the loss-given-default for securitized
% than for non-securitized mortgages, since the probability of default
% is known to be correlated with the loss-given-default
% \cite{qi2009loss}.
%
% Further, banks are required to keep part of the securitized
% mortgages on their balance sheets, so that banks have an incentive
% to exert less effort to collect information, not necessarily no
% effort at all. This will lead to a noisier, but not to completely
% uninformative signal for the lender in case of
% securitization. However, even with these additional issues we should
% expect the same prediction: that for a securitized mortgages the
% plaintiff is less informed than for non-securitized mortgages.

The hypothesis that the bank's information concerning the common value
component is \emph{less precise} for the securitized mortgages can
also be tested using banks' estimated bidding strategies. We do so
assuming the linear model
\[
u_B(x_B,x_S) = x_B+\alpha x_S .
\]
Proposition \ref{prop:slope} shows that the bank's strategy
$p_S(x_S;\alpha)$ is increasing in $\alpha$.  If banks holding
securitized mortgages are less informed than banks holding
non-securitized mortgages, then $\alpha$ is expected to be smaller for
the former. This leads to the following testable hypothesis.
%


\begin{conjecture}\label{hyp:slope}
  For bids below the judgment amount $v_J$, a bank holding a
  non-securitized mortgage chooses a higher bid $p^\text{nonsec}$ than
  a bank holding a securitized mortgage $p^\text{sec}$ given the same
  opportunity cost $x_S$. Formally, \[ p_S^{nonsec}(x_S) >
  p_S^{sec}(x_S), \quad\quad x_S>0 .\] \end{conjecture}

In the following, we test these hypotheses with our data.

% This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:securitization}.

\subsection{Data}

Since we have the name of the plaintiff in each foreclosure auction,
we can categorize mortgages as securitized vs non-securitized. We use
a simple classification rule, we classify a mortgage as securitized if
the name of the plaintiff contains at least one of the following
keywords: "trust", "asset backed", "asset-backed", "certificate",
"security", "securities", "holder".\footnote{Two examples of
  plaintiff's names that are classified as securitized are "US BANK
  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION AS TRUSTEE ON BEHALF OF THE HOLDERS OF THE
  ASSET BACKED SECURITIES CORPORATION HOME EQUITY LOAN TRUST SERIES
  AEG 2006-HE1 ASSET BACKED PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES SERIES AEG
  2006-HE1 HSBC MORTGAGE SERVCIES INC" and "DEUTSCHE BANK NATIONAL
  TRUST COMPANY AS TRUSTEE FOR ARGENT SECURITIES INC ASSET-BACKED
  PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES SERIES 2006-W2".} This simple
categorization does give false negatives (for some securitized
mortgages none of the keywords shows up in the name of the plaintiff),
but almost no false positives.

We have classified 3,249 mortgages as securitized and the remaining 9,539 as
non-securitized.\footnote{We only considered private label securitization,
since only 218 of the mortgages in our sample were securitized by
Government Sponsored Enterprises. We identified mortgages as securitized
by a Government Sponsored Enterprise as those for which the name of the
plaintiff contains one of the following: "Federal National Mortgage Assoc[iation]",
"Fannie Mae", "Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp[oration]", or "Freddie Mac".} Figure~\ref{fig:distr-maxbid-sec-nonsec} plots the
distributions of banks' bids for securitized and non-securitized
mortgages. The average difference of the bank's bid as a fraction of
the judgment amount is much lower for securitized than for
non-securitized mortgages, roughly 40 percentage points. This could be
explained by two effects. First, a selection effect that leads to
securitized mortgages being backed by houses of lower quality. Such a
selection effect at the foreclosure auction stage can be due to moral
hazard at a previous stage, when mortgages are granted. Second, the
signaling premium leads to banks bidding higher for non-securitized
than for securitized mortgages, since the common value component plays
a larger role.

One cannot directly disentangle these two effects, hence it cannot be
seen immediately whether there is more asymmetric information for
non-securitized than for securitized mortgages. However, we can use
our theory as a tool to uncover evidence of asymmetric information. We
will take two approaches for this. The first relies on our theoretical
results on the discontinuity of the probability of sale at the
judgment amount. For the second approach, we use additional data that
we hand collected for a subset of the data set to correct for the selection
effect.

\subsection{Discontinuity}


Our theoretical results on the judgment amount and the effect of the
common value component help us gain more insight on asymmetric
information. Recall that in the presence of asymmetric information, we
should expect an increase and then a discontinuity in the probability
of sale as a function of the bank's bid
(Hypothesis~\ref{hyp:discontinuity-sec-nonsec}).

Figures~\ref{fig:probability-of-sale-securitized} and
\ref{fig:probability-of-sale-nonsecuritized} show the probability of
sale as a function of the bank's bid for securitized and
non-securitized mortgages. For securitized mortgages, there is no
increase in the probability of sale below the judgment
amount. Further, the discontinuity at $v_J$ is much less pronounced
and indeed not statistically significant. For non-securitized
mortgages, we still see the same pattern as in
Figure~\ref{fig:discontinuity-data}. This is consistent with the
theory that asymmetric information plays less of a role for
securitized mortgages, since the trustee of the mortgage pool is less
likely to have an informational advantage over brokers than a local
bank.

\subsection{Bidding Strategy}

Figures~\ref{fig:probability-of-sale-securitized} and
\ref{fig:probability-of-sale-nonsecuritized} provide indirect evidence
for asymmetric information for non-securitized mortgages, while
there is no such evidence for the securitized mortgages. In this
section, we develop and implement a direct test of our Hypothesis
\ref{hyp:slope},
\[ p_S^{nonsec}(x_S) > p_S^{sec}(x_S).\]

While the theoretical predictions are clear, the empirical strategy is
more involved. It is not sufficient to observe that banks' bids are
higher for non-securitized than for securitized mortgages as depicted
in Fig.~\ref{fig:distr-maxbid-sec-nonsec}. The reason for a different
distribution of bids may be either the signaling premium (higher
$p_S(x_S)$ for a given $x_S$), a selection effect (different
distributions of $x_S$ for securitized and non-securitized mortgages),
or a combination of both. We have to control for $x_S$ in order to
identify the signaling premium.


In order to be able to control for $x_S$, we have hand-collected
additional information for a subsample of our data set, namely for
properties foreclosed in September 2011. In particular, we collected
the information on property transactions after foreclosure sales from
a different data source, a website powered by the Palm Beach County
Property Appraiser (a government agent). The information regarding the
property transactions are for ad valorem tax assessment purposes, as
stated in the disclaimer of the website. This implies the appraiser
exercises auditing procedures strictly to ensure the validity of any
transaction received and posted by that office.

For each foreclosure case, we first traced back the original legal
documents, from which we found the property address. We then used the
address to search in the database for the detailed features regarding
the property and its transaction history. The property appraiser
database provides information regarding the type of property (single
family, townhouse, zero lot line, etc.), its appraisal values for the
most recent three years, the next sale date, the next sale value, and
information on the next owner. Using this information, we were able to
recover some of the next resale values of the properties at
foreclosure.

A comparison of the data on foreclosed properties and the data from
the Property Appraiser's database revealed that a perfect matching of
observations in the two data sets is not possible, since the address
listed in the legal documents is not always of the same format (or
containing the same details) as the information recorded in the
appraisal database. In order to err on the side of caution, we only
used observations for which we can be certain about the matching.

We identified 332 properties among 644 foreclosed cases in the
month.\footnote{There were 983 properties listed for foreclosure for
  September 2011, but 339 of them were canceled prior to the auction
  dates.} The next sale of the foreclosed properties happened mostly
in the year of 2012, though a few of the properties were not resold
until early 2013. This leaves us with 250 observations for which the
resale price is available. Since our aim is to get an estimate of the
bank's valuation distribution, we only used the data from the
foreclosure auctions in which the bank won. This restricts our sample
to 199 observations, with 77 of them in the category of securitized
mortgages and 122 cases of non-securitized mortgages.

Table~\ref{tab:descriptive-securitization-resale} provides descriptive
statistics of the data collected. %\AN{[POSSIBLY ADD COLUMN WITH
  %ASSESSMENT VALUE/JUDGMENT AMOUNT.]} 
  The table suggests that part of
the difference in sales prices between securitized and non-securitized
mortgages is explained by a selection effect: the bank's resale price
in case it wins the auction is higher for non-securitized than for
securitized mortgages. In the following, we will disentangle the
selection and the signaling premium effect.

\begin{table}[!htbp]

    non-securitized mortgages. %\AN{[REPORT MEDIAN SALE PRICE/VJ INCLUDING OUTLIERS,

  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The bank's bidding behavior is determined by its opportunity cost of
selling $x_S$, which is the expected resale price. We identify the
distribution of the unobservable $x_S$ by specifying the following
correlation structure between $x_S$, the observable resale price $r$
and the (also observable) tax assessment value $a$.
%
%
%
% Hence, $x_S$ is a noisy signal of the resale price $r$, in the
% following we will assume that it there is multiplicative
% noise. Formally,
\begin{align*}
  \tilde r & = \tilde x_S + \epsilon_r, \quad \quad \tilde a = \tilde
  x_S + \epsilon_a
\end{align*}
where $\tilde x_S:=\ln x_S-E[\ln x_S]$ is the de-meaned
log-opportunity cost of the bank, and $\tilde r$, $\tilde a$ are the
de-meaned log-resale price and tax assessment, respectively. In this
specification, the noise terms $\epsilon_r$ and $\epsilon_S$ are
mutually independent, and are also independent of $\tilde x_S$.
%
% and $\epsilon_r$ is an error term. Note that we only observe $r$,
% but not $x_S$. To identify the distribution of $x_S$, we use
% additional information about the tax assessment value of a property
% $a$. $a$ is a noisy signal about the bank's opportunity cost
% $x_S$. Assuming multiplicative noise, we can write
% \[
% \tilde a = \tilde x_S + \epsilon_a
% \]
% where $\tilde a$ is defined analogously to $\tilde x_S$.
%
% Our identifying assumption for the identification of $x_S$ is that
% $\epsilon_r$ and $\epsilon_a$ are independently distributed.
% [POSSIBLY ADD JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS. AN AVENUE WE COULD POTENTIALLY
% GO IS THAT IF $\epsilon_r$ and $\epsilon_a$ WERE NOT INDEPENDENT,
% THE BANK COULD USE THE ASSESSMENT VALUE TO UPDATE ITS ESTIMATE OF
% THE RESALE PRICE.]
Following \cite{li1998nonparametric} and
\cite{krasnokutskaya2011identification}, the underlying distribution
of $x_S$ is non-parametrically identifiable under this assumption. One
could use standard non-parametric deconvolution techniques based on
Fourier transforms to obtain the distribution of $x_S$.

However, because of sample size issues, we take a semi-parametric
approach and parametrically deconvolute the noise in the following
way.  We can identify the variance of $\tilde x_S$ by considering the
variance of different combinations of $r$ and $a$. A simple example
for this is the following set of variances and the corresponding
equations:
\begin{align*}
  \text{Var}[\tilde r] & = \sigma_r^2 + \sigma_S^2 \\
  \text{Var}[\tilde a] & = \sigma_a^2 + \sigma_S^2 \\
  \text{Var}\left[\frac{1}{2}\tilde r + \frac{1}{2}\tilde a\right] & =
  \frac{1}{4}\sigma_r^2 + \frac{1}{4}\sigma_a^2+\sigma_S^2
\end{align*}
where $\sigma_S^2$, $\sigma_r^2$, and $\sigma_a^2$ are the variances
of $\tilde x_S$, $\epsilon_r$, and $\epsilon_a$, respectively. The
above is a system of three linear equations with three unknowns
$\sigma_i^2$, $i \in \{ S,r,a \}$, and has a unique solution.

The empirical variances of $\tilde r$, $\tilde a$, and $\tilde
r/2+\tilde a/2$ will thus lead to a consistent estimate of
$\sigma_S$. Further, we use the empirical mean of $r$ as an estimate
for the mean of $x_S$, which is also consistent. We further make the
parametric assumption that $x_S$, $r$, and $a$ are log-normally
distributed. Estimates of the distributions of $x_S$ are reported in
Table~\ref{tab:xs}. The difference in means reveals that there is
indeed a selection effect: securitized mortgages have a lower resale
price to judgment amount ratio $x_S/v_J$ than non-securitized
mortgages. In the following, we will show that this selection effect
cannot explain all the difference between securitized and
non-securitized mortgages.

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l|cc||cc}
      & $\mu_S$ & $\sigma_S$ & mean & std \\
      \hline
      securitized & -1.17236 & 0.429416 & 0.33954 & 0.152791 \\
      non-securitized & -1.01577 & 0.588605 & 0.430615 & 0.277086
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Distribution of $x_S/v_J$ for securitized and non-securitized
      mortgages. The estimate is based on a log-normal distribution
      $x_S/v_J\sim \ln N(\mu_S,\sigma_S)$.\label{tab:xs}}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


Next, observe that the distribution of banks' bids satisfies
$G_S(p_S(x_S))=F_S(x_S)$ for $p_S(x_S)<v_J$ if there is homogeneity with respect to 
asymmetric information.\footnote{We state results under the assumption of
homogeneity of asymmetric information for the sake of expositional clarity. These
results trivially extend to mixtures of symmetric and asymmetric auctions.} Since we only observe the distribution of the
bank's resale prices if the bank wins the auction, it is useful to
define $\tilde F_S(x_S)$ and $\tilde G_S(p_S)$ the distributions of
$x_S$ and $p_S$ conditional on winning the auction.
% and
%% as $\tilde F_S(x_S):=F_S(x_S)/(1-F_{(1)}(p_S(x_S)))$. Similarly,
%% let
% $\tilde G_S(p_S):= G_S(p_S)(1-F_S(p_S))$.
Because \[ \tilde F_S(x_S) =\tilde G_S(p_S(x_S)), \]we can write
\[
p_S(x_S) = \tilde G_S^{-1}(\tilde F_S(x_S))
\]
Given that we have estimates of $\tilde G_S$ and $\tilde F_S$ both for
securitized and for non-securitized mortgages, we can estimate $p_S$
for both types of mortgages.

% Note that without unobserved heterogeneity, the function $\tilde
% G_S^{-1}(\tilde F_S(x_S))$ can be interpreted as the bidding
% function $p_S(x_S)$. With unobserved heterogeneity it should be
% interpreted as an "average bidding function". If for some
% non-securitized mortgages there is a private value auction and for
% others a common value component auction, then $\tilde
% G_S^{-1}(\tilde F_S(x_S))$ will be a weighted average of
% $p_S^*(x_S)$ and $p_S^0(x_S)$. This average would still be higher
% than the bidding function $p_S^0(x_S)$ for securitized mortgages by
% Corollary~\ref{cor:bidding-sec-nonsec}. See
% Appendix~\ref{sec:avg-bid-heterogeneity} for more details.


Figure~\ref{fig:ps-xs-sec-nonsec} shows estimates of $p_S(x_S)$ for
securitized and non-securitized mortgages. The estimates are
consistent with our Hypothesis \ref{hyp:slope}, namely that the bank's
bid is higher for non-securitized than for securitized mortgages,
controlling for the bank's opportunity cost $x_S$. \PX{Showing inverse bidding function is good enough. 
there is no point showing bidding function in (a). It will elicit unnecessary questions and challenges. eg. small number of observations led non-sec bid increase too fast.}

Note that comparing the bidding functions for bids below $v_J$ is
difficult, since the bidding function below $v_J$ has a different
support for securitized and non-securitized mortgages, $[0,x_S^\text{sec}(v_J)]$
and $[0,x_S^\text{non-sec}(v_J)$, respectively. It is more
practical to compare the inverse bidding function $x_S(p_S)$ for
securitized and non-securitized mortgages, since the support is
$[0,v_J]$ in both cases. The inverse bidding functions are shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:xs-ps-sec-nonsec}. Computing the 90\% confidence
interval of the difference of the inverse bidding functions for
securitized and non-securitized mortgages reveals that the difference
is significant for high values of $p_S$, see
Figure~\ref{fig:xs-diff-10}.
% For low values of $p_S$, the difference is not significant and close
% to 0. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that the
% signaling premium is 0 at the lower bound of support.

\subsection{Implications}

The above analysis provides evidence for the existence of asymmetric
information in mortgage markets. The analysis uncovers a difference
between securitized and non-securitized mortgages and is consistent
with the hypothesis that banks holding securitized mortgages are
indeed less informed about the quality of the foreclosed property than
banks holding non-securitized mortgages.

This is consistent with the hypothesis of moral hazard in the
securitization process: if a mortgage is expected to be securitized,
then the originating bank has less incentives to collect information
about the quality of the mortgage and hence will be less informed. While the literature so far has focused
on moral hazard with respect to acquiring information about the
probability of default, our analysis has uncovered another dimension of moral hazard: the bank exerts insufficient effort
to collect information about the collateral value, which directly affects the loss given default. Our results
suggest that the effect of securitization on the loss given default is
equally important for the expected loss as the effect on the
probability of default. The bank's resale price as a fraction of the
judgment amount is 21\% lower for securitized than for non-securitized
mortgages (0.340 vs 0.431).\footnote{We provide results for the resale
  prices rather than losses given default, since there is more
  reliable data on this. A rough estimate of the difference in terms
  of the loss given default can be obtained by assuming that the loss
  given default is $v_J-x_S$. This would mean a 16\% higher loss given
  default for securitized than for non-securitized mortgages (1-0.340
  versus 1-0.431). The loss given default is typically higher than
  $v_J-x_S$, because of administrative costs.} This is comparable to
the 10\% to 20\% increase of the probability of default for
securitized versus non-securitized mortgages (5.5\% to 6\% versus 5\%)
estimated by \cite{keys2008did}.

The alternative explanation of adverse selection rather than moral
hazard is implausible because of the institutional details of the
securitization described at the beginning of this
section.\footnote{The candidate for an alternative explanation would
  be adverse selection with a pooling equilibrium, which leads to loss
  of information. For adverse selection and a separating equilibrium,
  no information is lost.} In particular, the special purpose vehicles
prevent originating banks from cherry picking the mortgages they want
to securitize and randomly selects mortgages from a mortgage pool. See
\cite{keys2008did} for more details.

% The information may also be lost in the securitization process. The originating bank may have additional informational advantages resulting from the intimate knowledge of the borrower's employment and income history, as well as  house improvements made by the borrower. It might apper that an institution that acts as a servicer of the securitized mortgage is less likely to have this information. However, mortgage originators are required to hold tranches of the mortgages they securitize, and thus may be able to pass this information to mortgage servicers. This makes this channel relatively less important.

Another alternative explanation is that originating banks do collect
information about the loss given default, but this information is lost
at a later stage. However, this is also implausible, because the originating bank
typically serves as the servicer of the mortgage and hence deals with the
foreclosure process \cite[see e.g.][]{cetorelli2012role}. Since the originating bank is required to hold
tranches of the securitized mortgage pool, they have an incentive to
make use of their information about quality of the collateral.

Another possible concern is a selection effect. Our first approach relies
on patterns showing up in the data (the non-monotonicity and discontinuity
of the probability of default) and does not rely on the assumption that
there is no selection effect. Our second approach -- the estimation of
the bidding function -- explicitly corrects for a selection effect in the
quality of securitized and non-securitized mortgages. However, there is a
selection effect we cannot control for with our foreclosure data: we only
observe mortgages that defaulted. An alternative hypothesis to moral hazard is
that securitized mortgages were less likely to default and hence it was less important to
collect information about the value of the collateral. However, the existing
literature actually finds the very opposite of this: securitized mortgages
are \emph{more} likely to default.\AN{cite elul for average PD. keys et al. 
provide evidence for "marginal" PD.} Hence more effort should be exerted
when investigating the collateral of securitized mortgages.

In the following, we will state the additional insight about policy questions
that can be gained from our analysis of foreclosure auctions. The usual
caveats apply: we are using data from Palm Beach County (FL) from 2010 to
2013. While it appears 
reasonable that data from other regions should reveal similar patterns,
more research is needed. Our theoretical results and empirical techniques
should facilitate such future research. Data from other periods of time
is likely to reveal other patterns, since we are picking up foreclosures
in the aftermath of the financial crisis in our data set. Such data should
provide additional insight about the evolution of asymmetric information
over time.

Another caveat is that policy should be guided by the bigger picture rather
than individual pieces of the picture, such as foreclosure auctions. Therefore,
we will mostly discuss policy recommendations based on the bigger picture
and state how our insights contribute to these.

Our results provide
further support for the concern about moral hazard in the
securitization process. Our findings hence speak in favor of policies
seeking to reduce moral hazard, such as requiring better documentation
for securitized mortgages, reducing tax benefits for securitization, or holding the
originating bank liable in case a mortgagee defaults (as is the case
for European covered bonds), see e.g. \cite{keys2008did}, \cite{dewatripont2010balancing},
\cite{tirole2011illiquidity}, \cite{campbell2013mortgage}.

Further, our results emphasize a new aspect of moral hazard in the
securitization process: the value of the collateral, which directly affects 
the loss given default. This suggests that
documentation not just of the characteristics of the borrower, but
also of the property is important. At the same time, our findings also
highlight some of the difficulties in new regulations: new regulatory
requirements set criteria for the documented loan-to-value ratio of
mortgages, e.g. the new Solvency II Directive of the European Union
requires that mortgages in the securitization pool to meet certain
requirements on the loan-to-value ratio.\footnote{See the Commission
  Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35, Article 177(1)(h).} However, our
results suggest that there is asymmetric information about the value
of properties and hence also about the loan-to-value ratio, which
reduces the effectivity of such regulation.


\section{Conclusions}

We develop a novel theory of foreclosure auctions and test some of its
predictions with data from Palm Beach county (Florida, US). We find
evidence for strategic bidding and asymmetric information, with the
bank being the informed party. First, the data reveal bunching in bids
at the judgment amount as the theory predicts bother under symmetric
and asymmetric information. Second, there is a non-monotonicity and discontinuity in the
probability of sale to the brokers, as the theory predicts under
asymmetric information. 

Our theory and empirical techniques have practical relevance: the presence
of asymmetric information is crucial for mortgage securitization. We look
separately at securitized and non-securitized mortgages and find that
for securitized mortgages, the bank has less of an informational advantage,
for two reasons. First, non-monotonicity and discontinuity are not present
for securitized mortgages. Second, banks bid lower for securitized mortgages.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that moral
hazard is involved in the securitization process: the banks 
may exert less effort collecting information about the value of the
property used as collateral for a mortgage. These findings complement
the findings in \cite{keys2008did} that banks collect less information
about the probability of default for securitized than for
non-securitized mortgages.



Our results can also be used for other policy relevant questions. One such
question is a welfare comparison of judicial and non-judicial foreclosures.
% Besides securitization as an application of our theory, we provide a
% second example of an application: the welfare comparison of judicial
% and non-judicial foreclosures.
According to \cite{nelson2004reforming}, roughly $40\%$ of the states
in the U.S. (including Florida) only allow judicial foreclosures,
i.e. the foreclosure auction has to be run by a court with rules as
the ones described in this article. The other half of the states allow
for both judicial and non-judicial foreclosures.  Mortgage contracts
with a so-called ``power of sale'' clause allow the bank to choose a
non-judicial foreclosure if the borrower defaults, i.e. the bank
can directly seize the property and sell it without going through a
court.

The power of sale clause allows the bank to market the property, and
to verifiably disclose, through inspections, some of the information
regarding its condition. This reduces the signalling premium, but
introduces another distortion. The bank, acting as a de facto owner of
the property, is no longer obligated to pay the owner back any auction
proceedings above the judgment amount. Thus the monopoly price
distortion now extends to prices above the judgment amount. So the
overall welfare effect of the power of sale is ambiguous. We plan to
estimate this effect in future work.

\section*{Appendix}
\section{Omitted Proofs}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:nonjudicial}]
  For the exposition, we assume $n \geq 2$. The proof for $n=1$ is
  parallel. It turns out convenient to restate the problem a bit
  differently. Consider the bank of type $x_S$ that contemplates a
  dropout price $p$, and assume that the brokers hold the belief $\hat
  x_S$ concerning the bank's type following the bank's dropout. For
  now, this belief is not necessarily the equilibrium belief.
  % The broker's dropout strategy is then given by $u_B(x_B, \hat
  % x_S)$ and the broker's cutoff $\hat X_B(p)$ is determined from the
  % indifference condition \[ u_B(\hat X_B(p),\hat x_S) = p .\]

  We restrict attention to equilibria where the broker's dropout
  strategy (if the bank has not dropped out) is a continuous, strictly
  increasing function, with a differentiable inverse $X_B^*(p)$. Then
  the bank's expected profit, as a function of own type $x_S$, the
  perceived type $\hat x_S$, and the price $p$ is given by
  \begin{align}
    \hat \Pi(x_S,\hat x_S,p) &= p (F_{(2)}(X_B^*(p)) - F_{(1)}(X_B^*(p)))\nonumber\\
    &+\int_{ X_B^*(p)}^{\infty} u_B(x,\hat x_S) f_{(2)}(x)dx +x_S
    F_{(1)}(X_B^*(p)).
    \label{eq:PiS}
  \end{align}
  % Here, we provisionally assume that the broker's dropout strategy
  % is a continuous, strictly increasing function, with a
  % differentiable inverse. This implies that the broker types with
  % $x_B > X_B (p)$ will prefer to continue bidding, while the types
  % $x_B < \hat X_B(p)$ will drop out earlier.
  A direct calculation shows that
  \begin{align} \frac{\partial \hat \Pi_S}{\partial p} &=
    (p-u_B(X_B^*(p),\hat x_S)) f_{(2)}(X_B^*(p))X_B^{*'}(p) \nonumber
    \\
    &+(x_S - p) f_{(1)}(X_B^*(p))X_B^{*'}(p) \nonumber
    \\
    &+F_{(2)}(X_B^*(p)) - F_{(1)}(X_B^*(p))
    % -n f_B(\hat X_B(p))F_B(\hat X_B(p))^{n-1} \Big( J_B(\hat
    % X_B(p),\hat x_S) - x_S \Big) \hat X_B'(p)
    \label{eq:sp}
  \end{align}
  and
  \begin{align} \frac{\partial \hat \Pi_S}{\partial \hat x_S} =
    \int_{\hat X_B(p)}^{\infty} \frac{\partial u_B(x,\hat
      x_S)}{\partial \hat x_S} f_{(2)}(x)dx .\end{align}


  The bank's expected profit following a deviation from the
  equilibrium price to some other price $\hat{p}$ is equal to $\hat
  \Pi_{S}(x_{S},X_{S}(\hat{p}),\hat{p})$.  In equilibrium, such a
  deviation should not be profitable,so that the following first-order
  condition (FOC) must hold for $p\in(\underline{p},\infty)$:
  \[
  \frac{\partial \hat \Pi_{S}(x_{S},X_{S}(p),p)}{\partial p}=0.
  \]
  Substituting into this FOC the bank's type that bids $p$,
  $x_{S}=X_{S}^*(p)$, we obtain the following differential equation:
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d X_{S}^*(p)}{dp} & =-\frac{\partial\hat
      \Pi_{S}(X_{S}^*(p),X_{S}^*(p),p)/\partial
      p}{\partial\Pi_{S}(X_{S}^*(p),X_{S}^*(p),p)/\partial\hat{x}_{S}}
    % \\
    % &=\frac{-n f_B(X_B^*(p))F_B(X_B^*(p))^{n-1} \Big(
    % J_B(X_B^*(p),X_S^*(p)) - X_S(p) \Big)} {\int_{\hat
    % X_B(p)}^{\infty} \frac{\partial u_B(x,X_S^*(p))}{\partial \hat
    % x_S} f_{(2)}(x)dx} \frac{dX_B^*(p)}{dp}
    \label{eq:ivp}
  \end{align}

  We now turn to the broker's equilibrium dropout strategy if the bank
  has not yet dropped out. We claim that the broker's strategy
  $X_B^*(p)$ defined as the solution (which will be shown unique later
  in the proof) to \begin{align}u_B(X_B^*(p),X_S^*(p)) =
    p,\label{eq:ubinproof}\end{align} is a best response. Consider
  first the scenario when it is known to the broker that the bank will
  drop out at price $p$.  Then it is optimal for the broker to drop
  out at the price $u_B(x_B,X_S^*(p))$, and the brokers with $x_B <
  X_B^*(p)$ will drop out at prices lower than $p$, while the brokers
  with $x_B > X_B^*(p)$ will drop out at higher prices.  If $X_B^*(p)$
  defined by \eqref{eq:ubinproof} is increasing, it follows that it is
  optimal to drop out at price $p'$ for a broker of type $X_B^*(p')$.
  Since this best response does not depend on $p$, we see that
  $X_B^*(p')$ is a best response also when the broker does not know
  the bank's dropout price $p$.

  Totally differentiating \eqref{eq:ubinproof} yields another
  differential equation linking $X_S^*(p)$ and $X_B^*(p)$:
  \begin{align}
    % u_B(X_B^*(p),X_S^*(p)) = p \implies
    \frac{\partial u_B}{\partial x_B}\frac{d X_B^*(p)}{dp} +
    \frac{\partial u_B}{\partial x_S}\frac{d X_S^*(p)}{dp}= 1.
    \label{eq:broker}
  \end{align}
  Equations \eqref{eq:ivp} and \eqref{eq:broker} form a linear system
  for $\frac{dX_S^*(p)}{dp}$ and $\frac{dX_B^*(p)}{dp}$; solving this
  system yields \eqref{eq:sdifeq} and \eqref{eq:bdifeq} in Proposition
  \ref{prop:nonjudicial}: \begin{align} \frac{d X_S^*(p)}{dp}&=
    \frac{(J_B(X_B^*,X_S^*)-X_S^*)]f_{(1)}(X_B^*)}{ \frac{\partial
        u_B}{\partial x_S} (u_B(X_B^*,X_S^*)-X_S^*)f_{(1)}(X_B^*)+
      \frac{ \partial u_B}{\partial x_B } \int_{X_B^*}^\infty
      \frac{ \partial u_B} {\partial x_S} f_{(2)}(x) dx
    }, \label{eq:sinproof} \\ \nonumber
    \\
    \frac{d X_B^*(p)}{dp}&= \frac{ F_{(2)}(X_B^*) - F_{(1)}(X_B^*) +
      \int_{X_B^*}^\infty \frac{ \partial u_B} {\partial x_S}
      f_{(2)}(x) dx }{ \frac{\partial u_B}{\partial x_S}
      (u_B(X_B^*,X_S^*)-X_S^*)f_{(1)}(X_B^*)+ \frac{ \partial
        u_B}{\partial x_B } \int_{X_B^*}^\infty \frac{ \partial u_B}
      {\partial x_S} \label{eq:binproof} f_{(2)}(x) dx } ,
  \end{align}
  subject to the initial conditions $X_S^*(\underline p) = 0$ and
  $X_B^*(\underline p) = \underline x$, where the cutoff $\underline
  x$ is uniquely determined from $u_B(\underline x, 0) = \underline
  p$.

  With a given value for $\underline x$, the solution to the system
  \eqref{eq:sinproof} and \eqref{eq:binproof} is unique by standard
  results in the theory of differential equations. We now claim that
  the only value of $\underline x$ compatible with equilibrium is the
  one given in the proposition, namely with $\underline x = \underline
  x_B$, uniquely determined from $J_B(\underline x_B,0) = 0$. This
  value corresponds to the full information outcome.

  Since $\hat X_B'(p) > 0$, it follows that the expected profit
  function $\hat \Pi (x_S,\hat x_S,p)$ satisfies the following
  \emph{single-crossing} condition: the ratio of the slopes
  \begin{align}
    \frac{\partial\hat\Pi_{S}(x_{S},\hat{x}_{S},p)/\partial
      p}{\partial\hat
      \Pi_{S}(x_{S},\hat{x}_{S},p)/\partial\hat{x}_{S}}
  \end{align}
  is increasing in $x_{S}$. This single-crossing condition implies
  that there are no profitable within-equilibrium deviations. Indeed,
  if $\hat{p}\geq\underline{p}$ is such a deviation, then differntial
  equation (\ref{eq:ivp}) implies
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{dX_{S}^*(\hat{p})}{dp} & =-\frac{\partial\hat
      \Pi_{S}(X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),\hat{p})/\partial
      p}{\partial\hat\Pi_{S}(X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),X_{S}^*(p),p)/\partial\hat{x}_{S}}
  \end{align*}
  This, however, contradicts the single-crossing condition, according
  to which $X_{S}^*(\hat{p})<x_{S}$ implies
  \[
  \frac{\partial\Pi_{S}(X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),\hat{p})/\partial
    p}{\partial\Pi_{S}(X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),\hat{p})/\partial\hat{x}_{S}}<\frac{\partial\Pi_{S}(x_{S},X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),\hat{p})/\partial
    p}{\partial\Pi_{S}(x_{S},X_{S}^*(\hat{p}),\hat{p})/\partial\hat{x}_{S}}
  \]
  Similarly, we can rule out an within-equilibrium deviation to a
  price $\hat{p}\in(p,\infty)$.

  We now claim that only the full information cutoff $\underline x =
  \underline x_B$ is compatible with the separating
  equilibrium. First, observe that any value $\underline x <
  \underline x_B$ corresponds to the solution of the system that is
  not monotonically increasing and therefore cannot correspond to a
  separating equilibrium. Next, if $\underline x > \underline x_B$,
  then it is profitable for the type $x_S=0$ to deviate to $p <
  \underline p$ even when the brokers' belief are the most
  pessimistic, $\hat x_S = 0$. The slope if the expected profit
  \eqref{eq:sp} is of the same sign as \[ -J_B(\underline x,0) <
  J_B(\underline x,0)=0, \text{ if } \underline x > \underline x_B .\]

  The cutoff $\underline x = \underline x_B$ does indeed yield the
  solution $(X_B^*(p),X_S^*(p))$ in which each function is
  monotonically increasing in $p$. First, note that equations
  \eqref{eq:sinproof} and \eqref{eq:binproof} form an autonomous
  system of differential equations. Every solution curve that is
  entirely contained in the region \[\mathcal M := \{ (x_B,x_S):
  x_S\geq 0, J_B(x_B,x_S) - x_S \geq 0 \] corresponds to a monotone
  increasing solution because the r.h.s. of \eqref{eq:sinproof} and
  \eqref{eq:binproof} are non-negative in (positive in the interior
  of) $\mathcal M$. Next, observe that the solution curve that starts
  at the point $(x_B,x_S) = (\underline x_B,0)$, i.e.\ in the
  south-west corner of $\mathcal M$ will never leave $\mathcal M$. The
  left boundary of $\mathcal M$ is given by the full information
  outcome, $\{ (x_B,x_S): J_B(x_B,x_S) - x_S = 0 \}$. This boundary is
  an increasing locus because $J_B(x_B.x_S)$ is assumed increasing in
  $x_B$. The vector field of the system points inside $\mathcal M$,
  with \ $dX_S^*(p)/dp = 0$ and $dX_B^*(p)/dp \geq 0$. Therefore, any
  solution with the initial condition in $\mathcal M$ will stay in
  $\mathcal M$. Since the initial condition $(\underline x_B, 0) \in
  \mathcal M$, we conclude that $X_B^*(p)$ and $X_S^*(p)$ are
  increasing in $p$.
%
  % that corresponds to the full information outcome. Our assumption
  % that $J_B(x_B.x_S)$ is increasing in $x_B$ ensures that this
  % boundary is an increasing locus, and the inspection of the
  % r.h.s. of \eqref{eq:sinproof} reveals that the vector flow points
  % inside $\mathcal M$, with \ $dX_S^*(p)/dp = 0$ and $dX_B^*(p)/dp
  % \geq 0$.
%
%
  % $\mathcal M \equiv \{ (x_B,x_S): x_S\geq 0, J_B(x_B,x_S) - x_S
  % \geq 0 \}$ where the r.h.s. of \eqref{eq:sinproof} is non-negative
  % (positive in the interior).


  Finally, in order to ensure that the bank with $x_S = 0$ indeed
  prefers to choose $\underline x_B$, it is sufficient to assume that
  for any lower (out of equilibrium) price, the brokers believe that
  the bank's type that deviated is the lowest one, $\hat x_S =
  0$. Then \eqref{eq:sp} implies that the slope of the expected profit
  is \emph{positive} for $p < \underline p$.


\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:slope}]
  Instead of the bank's bid strategy directly, in this proof it turns
  out convenient to work with the function $s(x_B)$, which gives the
  the bank's type $s$ as a function of the broker's type $x_B$ that
  would drop out at the same price as the bank. Then the bank's
  bidding strategy is given by
  \begin{align}
    p_S(x_S) &= u_B(s^{-\mathbbm 1}(x_S),x_S) \\&= s^{-\mathbbm
      1}(x_S)+\alpha x_S .
  \end{align}
  Dividing equation \eqref{eq:sdifeq} by \eqref{eq:bdifeq}, we get the
  following differential equation for $s(x_B)$,
  \[
  \frac{ds}{dx_B} = \frac{(\bar J(x_B) - (1-\alpha)
    s)f_{(1)}(x_B)}{\alpha \bar F_{(1)}(x_B)}
  \]
  where \[ \bar J(t) = t-\frac{1-F_B(t)}{f_B(t)} \] and $\bar
  F_{(1)}(x_B) = 1- F_{(1)}(x_B)$.

  % \cite{cai} consider an equivalent linear model. In their model, \[
  % u_B(\tilde x_B, \tilde x_S) = \tilde x_B+\tilde x_S, \quad\quad
  % u_S(\tilde x_S) = \gamma \tilde x_S, \quad \gamma > 1.\] Their
  % specification can be seen equivalent to ours if we put \[ \tilde
  % x_B = x_B - \alpha \mathbbm E x_S, \quad\quad \tilde x_S = \alpha
  % x_S, \quad\quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\alpha} .\]In this
  % specification, \[ p_S(\tilde x_S) = m (\tilde x_S) + \tilde
  % x_S, \] where $m(\tilde x_S)$ is the the broker's type $\tilde
  % x_B$ that would drop out at the same price as the bank with type
  % $\tilde x_S$. Since $\tilde x_S $ and $x_S$ have the same support
  % $\mathbbm R_+$, this implies that also for $p_S$ as a function of
  % $x_S$,
  % \[ p_S(x_S) = m (x_S) + x_S. \]
%
%
%
  % Theorem 3 in \cite{cai} shows that $s(\cdot) \equiv
  % m^{\mathbbm{-1}}(\cdot)$, t
  This equation can be integrated explicitly\footnote{The integration
    method is essentially the same as in the proof of Theorem 3 in
    \cite{cai2007reserve}. However, our linear specification is
    different and is not a special case of the linear specification in
    \cite{cai2007reserve}.}
  \begin{align*}
    s(x_B) = \gamma \bar F_{(1)}(x_B)^{\gamma - 1} \int_{\underline
      x_B}^{x_B} \bar F_{(1)}(t)^{-\gamma} f_{(1)}(t)\bar J(t)dt
  \end{align*}
  where \[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\alpha}\] and $\ul x_B$ is the lowest
  broker participating type, the same as under symmetric
  information, \[ \bar J(\ul x_B) = 0.\] The slope of $s(x_B)$ is
  given by
  \begin{multline}
    s'(x_B) =\gamma (\gamma - 1) f_{(1)}(x_B) \bar
    F_{(1)}(x_B)^{\gamma - 2} \int_{\underline x_B}^{x_B} \bar
    F_{(1)}(t)^{-\gamma} f_{(1)}(t)\bar J(t)dt +\gamma \bar
    F_{(1)}(x_B)^{-1} f_{(1)}(x_B) \bar J(x_B)
  \end{multline}
  With a change of variable
  \[
  y = \log \frac{\bar F_{(1)}(x_B)}{\bar F_{(1)}(t)},
  \]
  we have
  \[
  s'(x_B) = f_{(1)}(x_B)\int_{\ul y}^{0} \gamma (\gamma - 1)
  e^{(\gamma - 1) y} \tilde J(y) dy+\gamma \bar F_{(1)}(x_B)^{-1}
  f_{(1)}(x_B) \bar J(x_B)
  \]
  where $\tilde J(y) = \bar J (t(y))$, \[ \ul y < 0, \quad\quad \tilde
  J(\ul y) = 0 .\] Taking the derivative of the slope $s'(x_B)$ with
  respect to $\gamma$, and using the estimate
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{d}{d\gamma} \Big( \gamma (1-\gamma) e^{(\gamma - 1)y} \Big)
    &= \Big( 2 \gamma - 1+\gamma(\gamma - 1)\Big) e^{(\gamma - 1) y}
    \\&\geq \Big(1+(\gamma - 1)y \Big)e^{(\gamma - 1) y}
  \end{align*}
  we obtain the estimate
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{ds'(x_B)}{d \gamma} &\geq f_{(1)}(x_B)\int_{\ul y}^{0}
    \Big(1+(\gamma - 1)y \Big)e^{(\gamma - 1) y} \tilde J(y) dy+\bar
    F_{(1)}(x_B)^{-1} f_{(1)}(x_B) \bar J(x_B).
  \end{align*}
  The second term above is positive. As far as the first term, the
  extended mean-value theorem for integrals implies for some $a \in
  [\ul y,0]$\footnote{The second mean-value theorem for integrals
    states that $\int_a^b f(t)g(t)dt = g(a) \int_a^c f(t)dt+ g(b)
    \int_c^b f(t)dt$ whenever $f,g$ are continuous functions on
    $[a,b]$. See Theorem 2.12.17 on p.150 in
    \cite{bogachev2007measure}. Here, this theorem is applied with
    $g(t) = \tilde J(t)$, taking into account $\tilde J(\ul y) = 0$.}
  \begin{align*}
    \int_{\ul y}^{0} \Big(1+(\gamma - 1)y \Big)e^{(\gamma - 1) y}
    \tilde J(y) dy &= \tilde J(0) \int_{\ul y}^{0} \Big(1+(\gamma -
    1)y \Big)e^{(\gamma - 1) y} dy \\&=J(x_B) \int_{\ul y}^{0}
    d\Big(ye^{(\gamma - 1) y}\Big) \\&=-J(x_B) a e^{(\gamma - 1) \ul
      a}\geq 0
  \end{align*}
  where the last line follows from $a<0$. So we conclude \[
  \frac{ds'(x_B)}{d \gamma}> 0.\] Since $\gamma = 1/\alpha$, this
  implies $\frac{ds'(x_B)}{d \alpha}<0$, which in turn implies that
  the slope of the inverse $s^{-\mathbbm 1}(x_S)$ is increasing in
  $\alpha$. Since $p_S(x_S;\alpha) = s^{-\mathbbm 1}(x_S)+\alpha x_S$,
  we conclude that the slope of $p_S(x_S;\alpha)$ is increasing in
  $\alpha$. Since $p_S(0) = \ul x_B$ is independent of $\alpha$, this
  implies $p_S(x_S;\alpha)$ increases in $\alpha$.

  \eqref{eq:sindif0} can be equivalently stated as
  \begin{align}
    (\hat p(\underline p_S) - \underline
    x_S)(1-F_{(1)}(X_B^*(p_S^*(\underline x_S)))) = (\hat p(v_J) -
    \underline x_S)(1-F_{(1)}(\overline x_B)), \label{eq:sindif}
  \end{align}
  where $\hat p(p)$ denotes the equilibrium price received by the bank
  \emph{conditional} on winning the auction with a reserve $p$.
  % As a matter of fact, we impose a stronger indifference condition
  % for the bank: in our equilibrium, the bank with $\underline x_S$
  % will be indifferent over \emph{any} price in $[\underline p_S,\ol
  % x_B]$.
  The bank's indifference condition \eqref{eq:sindif} defines $\ol
  x_B$ as an implicit function of $\underline x_S$.
  % and therefore, through $\underline x_S = p_S^{*-1}(\bar
  % p_B^*(x_B^1))$, as a function of the lower cutoff $x_B^1$.
  This function is denoted as $y_B(\cdot)$.  The indifference
  condition \eqref{eq:sindif} can be re-written as
  \[
  F_{(1)}(\ol x_B)=1-\frac{\Pi_S(\underline x_S)}{\hat
    p(v_J)-\underline x_S}
  \]
  where we denoted the broker's type that corresponds to $\underline
  x_S$ as $\tilde x_B(\underline x_S) =X_B(p_S^*(\underline x_S)))$,
  and
  \[ \Pi_S(\underline x_S) = (\hat p(p_S^*(\underline
  x_S))-x_S)(1-F_{(1)}(\tilde x_B(\underline x_S)) .\] Next, we show
  that $\Pi_S(\underline x_S)/(\hat p(v_J)-\underline x_S)$ is
  increasing in $\underline x_S$, which implies that $\ol x_B$ is
  decreasing in $\underline x_S$. The derivative of this function is
  \[
  \frac{d}{d\underline x_S} \frac{\Pi_S(\underline x_S)}{\hat
    p(v_J)-\underline x_S} = \frac{\Pi_S'(\underline x_S)(\hat
    p(v_J)-\underline x_S)+\Pi_S(\underline x_S)}{(\hat
    p(v_J)-\underline x_S)^2}
  \]

  The envelope theorem implies $\Pi_S'(\underline x_S) =
  -(1-F_{(1)}(\tilde x_B(\underline x_S)))$. So the numerator is equal
  to
  \begin{align*}
    &  \Pi_S(\underline x_S)-(\hat p(v_J)-\underline x_S)(1-F_{(1)}(\tilde x_B(\underline x_S))) \\
    & = \Pi_S(\underline x_S)-(\hat p(p_1)-\underline
    x_S)(1-F_{(1)}(\tilde x_B(\underline x_S))) - (\hat p(v_J)-\hat
    p(p_1))(1-F_B(\tilde x_B(\underline x_S)))
    \\
    & = -(\hat p(v_J)-p_1)(1-F_{(1)}(\tilde x_B(\underline x_S))) < 0
  \end{align*}
  where the inequality follows since $p_1<v_J$ and $\hat p(\cdot)$ is
  a an increasing function. Hence, $y_B(\underline x_S)$ is a
  \emph{decreasing} function.


  The broker's indifference condition \eqref{eq:bindif0},
  $H(\underline x_S,\ol x_B) = v_J$, defines $\ol x_B$ as an implicit
  function of $\underline x_S$, \[ \ol x_B=z(\underline x_S).\]
  Indeed, we have $H(\ul x_S,v_J)<0$ and, for $\ol x_B \geq
  v_J$, \begin{align*} \frac{\partial H(\underline x_S,\ol
      x_B)}{\partial \ol x_B} &= \Big( u_B(\ol x_B,\ol x_B) - \ol x_B
    \Big)f_S(\ol x_B)+\int_{\ul x_S}^{\ol x_B} \frac{\partial u_B(\ol
      x_B,x_S)}{\partial \ol x_B} f_S(x_S) dx_S
    \\
    &= \int_{\ul x_S}^{\ol x_B} \frac{\partial u_B(\ol
      x_B,x_S)}{\partial \ol x_B} f_S(x_S) dx_S
    \\
    &\geq \theta (F_S(\ol x_B) - F_S(v_J)),
  \end{align*}
  where we have used the assumption that $\partial u_B/\partial x_B
  \geq \theta >0$. By integration, it then follows that for $\ol x_B
  \geq v_J$,
  \[
  H(\ul x_S, \ol x_B) \geq H( \ul x_S,v_J) + \int_{v_J}^{\ol x_B}
  (F_S(y) - F_S(v_J))dy \to \infty
  \]
  as $\ol x_B \to \infty$. So for a given $\ul x_S < v_J$, $H(\ul
  x_S,\ol x_B)$ is an increasing function of $\ol x_B$, tending to
  $\infty$, with $H(\ul x_S,v_J) < 0$. This implies that the equation
  $H(\ul x_S, \ol x_B) = 0$ defines $\ol x_B$ as an implicit function
  of $\ul x_S$. This function will be denoted as $z(\ul x_S)$,
  \[ H( \ul x_S, z_B(\ul x_S)) = 0 . \]

  We now show that $z_B(\cdot)$ is an \emph{increasing} function. This
  will follow from the fact that $ H(\underline x_S,\ol x_B)$ defined
  in \eqref{eq:bindif0} is an increasing function in first two
  arguments. We have already shown that $H(\ul x_S,\ol x_B)$ is
  increasing in $\ol x_B$ for $\ol x_B \geq v_J$. Now
  \begin{align*}
    \frac{\partial H(\underline x_S,\ol x_B)}{\partial \ul x_S}=
    (v_J-u_B(\ol x_B,\ul x_S))f_S(\ul x_S).
  \end{align*}
  We claim that $u_B(\ol x_B,\ul x_S)<v_J$, so that $H(\ul x_S, \ol
  x_B)$ is indeed increasing in $\ul x_S$. We argue by
  contradiction. If not, we would have
  \begin{align}
    H(\ul x_S, \ol x_B) \geq \int_{v_J}^{\ol x_B} \Big( u_B(\ol x_B,
    x_S) - x_S \Big) f_S(x_S)dx_S,\label{eq:Hinproof}
  \end{align}
  Given our assumption $\partial u_B/\partial x_S <1$, we have for
  $x_S < \ol x_B$,
  \begin{align*}
    u_B(\ol x_B, x_S)& = u_B(\ol x_B, \ol x_B) - \int_{x_S}^{\ol x_B}
    \frac{\partial u_B(\ol x_B,x_S)}{\partial x_S} dx_S
    \\
    &> \ol x_B - \int{x_S}{\ol x_B} dx_S = x_S.
  \end{align*}
  Substituting this bound into \eqref{eq:Hinproof}, we get
  \begin{align*}
    H(\ul x_S, \ol x_B) &> \int_{v_J}^{\ol x_B} \Big( u_B(\ol x_B,x_S)
    - x_S \Big) f_S(x_S)dx_S
    \\
    &>0,
  \end{align*}
  a contradiction to $H(\ul x_S, \ol x_B) = 0$. So we conclude
  \[ \frac{\partial H(\underline x_S,\ol x_B)}{\partial \ul x_S}>0.
  \]
  The Implicit Function Theorem now implies that $z_B(\cdot)$ is
  increasing:
  \[ z_B'(\ul x_S) = - \frac{\partial H/\partial \ul x_S}{\partial H
    /\partial \ol x_B}>0. \]

  \label{fig:intersection}
\end{figure}


Thus $y_B(\ul x_S)$ and $z_B(\ul x_S)$ are both continuous, and are,
respectively, decreasing and increasing functions. Continuing with the
proof, let $\hat x_S = X_S^*(v_J)$ and $\hat x_B = X_B^*(v_J)$ be the
bank's and broker's types in the bank-seller equilibrium ($v_J =
0$). The lower cutoff values are restricted between the lowest
possible value $0$, and $\hat x_S$. Both mapping $y_B(\cdot)$ and
$z_B(\cdot)$ are defined on the domain $[0,\hat x_S ]$.



Since the $\hat x_B$ type breaks even if the bank drops out at $v_J$
in the bank-seller equilibrium ($v_J = 0$), we must have $H(\hat
x_S,\hat x_B)>0$. The monotonicity of $H(\underline x_S,\ol x_B)$ in
$\ol x_B$ implies $z_B(\hat x_S)<\hat x_B$. At the same time, the
definition of $y_B(\cdot)$ implies $\hat x_B = y_B(\hat x_S)$, and it
follows that $z_B(\hat x_S)<y_B(\hat x_S)$.  Refer to
Figure~\ref{fig:intersection}. In view of the monotonicity of
$y_B(\cdot)$ and $z_B(\cdot)$, there are two possibilities. First, if
$z_B(0) \geq y_B(0)$, then type-$0$ bank prefers to bid $\ul p$ rather
than $v_J$. In this case, the curves $y_B(\ul x_S)$ and $z_B(\ul x_S)$
have a unique intersection given by
\begin{align}
  \ol x_B = y_B(\underline x_S)=z_B(\underline
  x_S), \label{eq:intersection}
\end{align}
with $\ol x_S \in (0,\hat x_S)$. If, on the other hand, $z_B(0) <
y_B(0)$, then type-$0$ bank prefers to bid $v_J$, so that the
equilibrium involves $\ol x_B = 0$ and the bunching extends all the
way to $x_S = 0$.
%
% The equilibrium cutoffs $\underline x_S$ and $\ol x_B$ are given by
% the intersection of the graphs of $y_B(\cdot)$ and $z_B(\cdot)$,

% \section{Average Bidding Function in the Presence of
% Heterogeneity}\label{sec:avg-bid-heterogeneity}
%
% It may be reasonable to expect that even for non-securitized
% mortgages, some properties are better characterized by symmetric
% information. So as before, assume that a certain fraction of
% properties corresponds to symmetric information ($\alpha = 0$),
% while the remaining properties are better described by asymmetric
% information ($\alpha = 1$). The parameter $\alpha$ represents
% unobserved heterogeneity (to the econometrician). Then
% \begin{align*}
%   G_S^w(p_S(x_S;\alpha)|\alpha) = F_S(x_S|\alpha), \quad\quad \alpha
%   \in \{ 0,1 \}
% \end{align*}
% Averaging over the values of $\alpha$, we have (keeping in mind that
% $p_S(x_S; 0) = p_S^0(x_S)$ and $p_S(x_S;1) = p_S(x_S)$ in our
% previous notation),
% \[
% G_S^w(p_S^0(x_S)|0)\mathbbm P(\alpha = 0) +
% G_S^w(p_S(x_S)|1)\mathbbm P(\alpha = 1) = F_S(x_S)
% \]
% Since the signalling premium implies $p_S^0(x_S) < p_S(x_S) $, it
% follows that there exists $\hat p_S(x_S)$,
% \[ p_S^0(x_S) < \hat p_S(x_S) < p_S(x_S) \] such that
% \[ \hat p_S(x_S) = G_S^{w-\mathbbm 1}(F_S(x_S)) \] and Hypothesis
% \ref{hyp:sp} continues to hold, except that the identifiable object
% $G_S^{w-\mathbbm 1}(F_S(x_S))$ is now interpreted as $\hat
% p_S(x_S)>p_S^0(x_S)$.
